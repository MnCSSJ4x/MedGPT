Although hairy tongue normally resolves on its own, patients are encouraged to avoid the factors that have been shown to bring about hairy tongue. Treatment usually involves gentle cleaning of the tongue with a soft toothbrush.  Medication is rarely prescribed for hairy tongue; however, in severe cases, antifungals, retinoids or mouthwashes may be used.  If treatment fails, the affected portion of the tongue called the papillae (finger-like projections) may be clipped or removed using techniques such as carbon dioxide laser burning or electrodesiccation (a procedure in which an electrical current is used to seal of the affected area).",105,": 

    This is a fact. Hairy tongue is a condition where no specific treatment is effective due to its inability to produce any full-grown, mucous secretion. This condition has been described as the Hairy ""Vigar Virus"". 
      
      

    From a medical perspective, the symptoms of Hairy tongue are generally not uncommon, yet treatment for this condition may be difficult or expensive. It is important to consider the factors that led to the infection, and if one solution is needed, it may be better to treat it in the first place.

There are three main types of CPT2 deficiency: a lethal neonatal form, a severe infantile hepatocardiomuscular form, and a myopathic form. The neonatal and infantile forms are severe multisystemic diseases characterized by liver failure with hypoketotic hypoglycemia (extremely low levels of ketones (substances produced when fat cells break down in the blood) and low blood sugar), cardiomyopathy, seizures, and early death. The myopathic form is characterized by exercise-induced muscle pain and weakness and occasional myoglobinuria (rust-colored urine indicating breakdown of muscle tissue). Mutations in the CPT2 gene cause CPT2 deficiency. It is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Treatment is based on avoidance of prolonged fasting and a low-fat and high-carbohydrate diet.",136,": 

    If Carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2 deficiency is present in cats, it is likely an illness caused by some type of digestive tumor. 
    If the cat is suffering from a urinary tract infection, one potential source of Carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2 deficiency is an antibiotic-containing diet. 
   
    If Carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2 deficiency is present in the presence of certain vitamin C or certain omega-3 fatty acids, it may also affect the production of antioxidants, which may help with cellular processes essential for cell growth.

It is one of the many diseases that can cause the nephrotic syndrome. C1q is a normal protein in the immune system, and can be found floating in the circulation of most healthy people. In C1q nephropathy, however, this protein can also be found deposited throughout the kidneys. It has been thought to be a subgroup of primary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis or to be a combination of several disease groups rather than a single disease. As a disease, it is very similar to minimal change disease (MCD) and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). Criteria diagnosis includes C1q deposits on the kidney and no evidence of systemic lupus erythematosus. Both children and adult patients may have no symptoms, except for the presence of blood or protein in the urine, or  present with swelling of the feet and legs, high blood pressure and kidney insufficiency.

About 80 percent of cases are caused by mutations in the COL4A5 gene and are inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern. This gene is located on the X chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. In males (who have only one X chromosome), one altered copy of the COL4A5 gene in each cell is sufficient to cause kidney failure and other severe symptoms of the disorder. In females (who have two X chromosomes), a mutation in only one copy of the COL4A5 gene usually only results in hematuria, but some women experience more severe symptoms. A characteristic of X-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass X-linked traits to their sons.",124,": 

    The genetic predisposition of Alportism is quite broad and encompasses all the variants that are not normal in individuals. It is also a predisposition of children and adolescents, although the exact details are unclear. Genetic inheritance of Alortism is a genetic trait that has various variations, such as heterozygosity or haplogroups. The genetic predisposition of Alortism is also an inheritance of multiple genes. In contrast, the exact genetic predisposition of Alortism goes mostly unnoticed, and it is therefore not unusual to have a more or less prominent one. The specific gene that influences Alortism is not always very clearly identified, and most people cannot reliably identify and identify this trait in one form or another.

If little or no tetrahydrobiopterin is available to help process phenylalanine, this amino acid can build up in the blood and other tissues and the levels of neurotransmitters (dopamine, serotonin) and folate in cerebrospinal fluid are also decreased. This results in neurological symptoms such as psychomotor delay, low muscle tone (hypotonia), seizures, abnormal movements, too much salivation, and swallowing difficulties.

It is considered an immune-mediated disorder (due to an abnormal immune system response), both because IVIG therapy improves symptoms, and many patients have anti-GM1 antibodies. Research to further understand the cause of MMN is underway.",52,": 

    There is a very specific sequence for Multifocal motor neuropathy, which is a form of visual or auditory sensitivity, which is one of the few areas of the body where motor nerve impulses occur. This region can be thought of as being at the pole of the neck and is referred to as the focal region. It provides the nerve impulse which is responsible for motor motor function in the central nervous system.
A similar issue exists as hearing impairment, which can lead to hearing loss and an increased sensitivity to sound. In some cases, hearing loss can lead to a range of other neurological effects. On the other hand, hearing impairment can be treated with transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (tDCS) as an alternative treatment for multifocal motor neuropathy, which improves auditory perception"

    A multifocal motor neuropathy is commonly found in children, adolescents, and adults. In adults, this has been considered to be a recessive disorder with symptoms that typically worsen with age. 
   

    It is difficult to determine the cause of multifocal motor disorder without prior medical treatment. However, some experts believe that it may be due to age-related factors, such as age-related cognitive dysfunction, excessive social interaction, or other underlying psychological disorders.

Multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) is considered treatable with intravenous immune globulin (IVIG). Early treatment shortly after symptoms begin is recommended. Most people have a fairly rapid improvement in weakness with IVIG, but the improvement generally does not last beyond a few months. Maintenance IVIG infusions are usually needed every two to six weeks. For those with severe disease whose symptoms don't respond to IVIG (or for those who become resistant), treatment options are limited. Several reports have suggested that cyclophosphamide may be partially effective.",91,": 

    The treatments for multifocal motor neuropathy typically include cognitive remediation, balance-training exercises, electroconvulsive therapy, medication or exercise therapy, and joint therapy.

Tourette syndrome is named for Georges Gilles de la Tourette, who first described this disorder in 1885. A variety of genetic and environmental factors likely play a role in causing Tourette syndrome. A small number of people with Tourette syndrome have been found to have mutations involving the SLITRK1 gene. The syndrome is believed to be linked to problems in certain areas of the brain, and the chemical substances (dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine) that help nerve cells talk to one another. It is estimated that about 1% of the population has Tourette syndrome. Many people with very mild tics may not be aware of them and never seek medical help. Tourette syndrome is four times as likely to occur in boys as in girls. Although Tourette syndrome can be a chronic condition with symptoms lasting a lifetime, most people with the condition experience their worst symptoms in their early teens, with improvement occurring in the late teens and continuing into adulthood.",182,":

Although the cause of Tourette syndrome is unknown, current research points to abnormalities in certain brain regions (including the basal ganglia, frontal lobes, and cortex), the circuits that interconnect these regions, and the neurotransmitters (dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine) responsible for communication among nerve cells. Given the often complex presentation of Tourette syndrome, the cause of the disorder is likely to be equally complex. In many cases, there is a family history of tics, Tourette Syndrome, ADHD, OCD. In 2005, scientists discovered the first gene mutation that may cause some cases of Tourette syndrome. This gene, named SLITRK1, is normally involved with the growth of nerve cells and how they connect with other neurons.  The mutated gene is located in regions of the brain (basal ganglia, cortex, and frontal lobes) previously identified as being associated with Tourette syndrome.",141,": 

    The correct answer is 'tetrenyl acetate'. Tourette syndrome is a neurological condition that causes tremors, tinnitus, or tinnitus ringing in the chest, which can cause difficulty speaking and speaking normally. It can also cause fatigue and difficulty speaking at all.

Although early family studies suggested an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance (an autosomal dominant disorder is one in which only one copy of the defective gene, inherited from one parent, is necessary to produce the disorder), more recent studies suggest that the pattern of inheritance is much more complex. Although there may be a few genes with substantial effects, it is also possible that many genes with smaller effects and environmental factors may play a role in the development of Tourette syndrome. Genetic studies also suggest that some forms of ADHD and OCD are genetically related to Tourette syndrome, but there is less evidence for a genetic relationship between Tourette syndrome and other neurobehavioral problems that commonly co-occur with Tourette syndrome.

Out of the various cancers linked to limbic encephalitis, the typically associated tumors are SCLC, which are present in about 40% of patients that have the paraneoplastic form of limbic encephalitis.  Seminoma are present in 25% of patients.  At a lower rate, nearly any other tumor may be associated.  Limbic encephalitis can also occur in the absence of cancer such as in the case of an viral infection and systemic autoimmune disorders.  The underlying cause of limbic encephalitis is probably an autoimmune reaction which is brought about by cancer, tumors, infections, or autoimmune disorders.",127,":

Most cases of Sneddon syndrome occur in people with no other family history of the condition, however there have been a few families with more than one member affected. A recent study found that in one family, Sneddon syndrome developed as a result of inheriting two changes in the CECR1 gene. In this family, Sneddon syndrome was inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. Other case reports of familial Sneddon syndrome suggest an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance.  It is not currently known if all familial cases are due to changes in CECR1.

Replacement therapy with NaCl (sodium chloride) and KCl (potassium chloride) has been shown to be effective in children. One study showed that a medication called omeprazole, a proton-pump inhibitor, reduces electrolyte losses in individuals and thus promotes a positive gastrointestinal balance.

Yes, I can provide you with some information about the syndrome of Stiff person syndrome. Stiff person syndrome is a common condition that affects a person's sense of taste, hearing, and smell, leading to loss of taste, hearing loss, and sensitivity to pain. It can affect a person's lifestyle, as well, and it may require some medical attention. Stiff person syndrome can be especially difficult to diagnose, as it can have many genetic and environmental factors that can interfere with its development. In addition, STIFF person syndrome can have a range of side effects, including nausea, dizziness, and headache."
8710,8710,12739,causes,What causes Stiff person syndrome ?,"What causes stiff person syndrome? Scientists dont yet understand what causes stiff person syndrome, but research indicates that it is the result of an abnormal autoimmune response in the brain and spinal cord. Most people with stiff person syndrome have antibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), a protein in some nerve cells involved in making a substance called gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) that helps to control muscle movement. The symptoms of stiff person syndrome may develop when the immune system mistakenly attacks the neurons that produce GAD, leading to a deficiency of this protein in the body. The exact role that deficiency of GAD plays in the development of stiff person syndrome is not fully understood.",115,": 

    This condition is caused by a number of factors and most common causes, such as diabetes, high blood pressure and certain genetic conditions, over-eating. It can also affect people's daily activities, making it more difficult to reach goals.

The fact that stiff person syndrome can occur with other autoimmune disorders suggests that genetics may play a role.",52,": 

    It is difficult to conclude that Stiff person syndrome is acquired due to the presence or absence of physical abnormalities linked to a genetic abnormality. It is always a good idea to consult a healthcare professional before making any health decisions. This may include conducting laboratory tests to confirm the presence of abnormalities on specific patients, looking into any potential genetic conditions or genetic testing results and making a diagnosis or any other actionable decision related to a potential issue.

Stiff person syndrome may be inherited from a single mother or a family of similar twins. However, it is important to note that the exact genetic nature of the syndrome is still a subject of debate. The most frequently diagnosed case among individuals with Stiff person syndrome is genetic disorder GPT, and individuals of similar ages may have similar gene mutations that contribute to the disorder.

Other types of dextrocardia may involve defects of the walls of the heart, nearby blood vessels, or other organs in the abdomen. Chest X-raxys and echocardiograms can be used to determine which type of dextrocardia is present.",91,": 

    This is a question of diagnostic imaging, and a dextrocardia diagnosis requires a diagnosis of a blood clot. Dextrocardia provides clear evidence of blood clot formation outside the thrombus in the lower abdomen, which can help physicians determine if a clot is present when a person is trying to urinate. For example, if a person is trying to inhale, the blood clots may be visible to them for several moments beforehand due to a lack of oxygen, resulting in redness of the throat and congestion. If the clot develops, it can be hard to distinguish between the two hemispheres and the person will need to be transported home or monitored.

There are clinical diagnostic criteria for Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) that were developed in the past that continue to be useful. These criteria can be viewed on the National Institute of Health's NICHD Web site. However, the current mainstay of a diagnosis when PWS is suspected is a form of genetic testing called DNA methylation testing. This testing can detect abnormal, parent-specific imprinting on the region of chromosome 15 that is responsible for PWS. It determines whether the region is maternally inherited only (i.e., the paternally contributed region is absent) and confirms a diagnosis in more than 99% of affected people. DNA methylation testing is especially important in people who have non-classic features, or are too young to show enough features to make the diagnosis based on signs and symptoms alone.",135,":

Over time, there may be eye halos, glare, or other night vision problems.The cause is unknown, but the tendency to develop keratoconus is probably present from birth. Keratoconus is thought to involve a defect in collagen, the tissue that makes up most of the cornea. Some researchers believe that allergy and eye rubbing may play a role. Treatment for keratoconus depends on the severity of your condition and how quickly the condition is progressing. Mild to moderate keratoconus can be treated with eyeglasses or contact lenses.

The genetic factors involve abnormalities in the structure of collagen, which result in a weak and flexible cornea. Keratoconus is more common in people with Down syndrome, Marfan syndrome, and Leber congenital amaurosis, and certain genetic conditions. In these cases, the cause depends on the specific condition.  Environmental factors may include living in sunny, hot areas of the world, while eye-rubbing is a major behavioral factor in the disease. Malfunctioning enzymes that normally help maintain the health of the cornea may play a role. All of these factors contribute to the main problem in keratoconus, which is the defective collagen structure that results in thinning and irregularity of the cornea. Keratoconus occurs more frequently in patients with atopy (asthma and eczema) or severe ocular allergies. It may also be linked to hormonal factors because it is more frequent during puberty and also may progress during pregnancy.",170,":

---------------*Congenital Hyperplasia is a rare disease that affects a large part of the liver. It primarily affects adults of reproductive age and can be treated with antiviral medications such as fluoxetine, acetaminophen, and venlafaxine.

Congenital Hyperplasia is one of the many autoimmune disorders that are leading to the depletion of all lymphatic cells in the body and liver. The immune system has recently developed a protective mechanism to fight off the disease, which means that people with congenital Hyperplasia or who've been immunoallocated are at an increased risk of illness.

Signs and symptoms include severe intellectual disability; low birth weight; a small, abnormally shaped head; a small jaw and mouth; clenched fists with overlapping fingers; congenital heart defects; and various abnormalities of other organs. Trisomy 18 is a life-threatening condition; many affected people die before birth or within the first month of life. Some children have survived to their teenage years, but with serious medical and developmental problems. Most cases are not inherited and occur sporadically (by chance).",98,": 

    Trisomy 18 is a surgical procedure performed by the same surgical team responsible for diagnosing tumors. With trisomy 18, the surgeon engages a special section of the spine that receives signals from the surgeon’s hand in order to implant a new surgical procedure. This helps to increase the number of viable bone marrow cells that can be used for the procedure. 
  
    
    If the tumors continue to grow, it could be even more challenging to recover fully until other treatments, such as chemotherapies or immunotherapy, can help to slow the process. Even before the surgery is complete, the surgeon’s skin and muscles may be affected and even require ongoing surgeries.
  
   
    
    
"
8758,8758,12840,causes,What causes Trisomy 18 ?,"What causes Trisomy 18? In most cases, trisomy 18 is caused by having 3 copies of chromosome 18 in each cell in the body, instead of the usual 2 copies. The extra genetic material from the 3rd copy of the chromosome disrupts development, causing the characteristic signs and symptoms of the condition. About 5% of people with trisomy 18 have 'mosaic trisomy 18' (when there is an extra copy of the chromosome in only some of the body's cells). The severity of mosaic trisomy 18 depends on the number and locations of cells with the extra copy. Very rarely, an extra piece of chromosome 18 is attached to another chromosome; this is called translocation trisomy 18, or partial trisomy 18. If only part of the long (q) arm of chromosome 18 is present in 3 copies, the features may be less severe than in people with full trisomy 18.",149,": 

    In addition to the symptoms such as pain, fatigue, and headaches, these conditions can also cause complications such as scarring and fractures. Trisomy 18 can cause an enlarged lymph node that can lead to anemia, and an increased risk for type 2 lung cancer and various chronic infections that can lead to their mortality. Furthermore, anemia and some chronic infections can also affect the immune system, leading to reduced production of hormones. Consequently, the treatment of Trisomy 18 is vital and may be particularly beneficial for controlling such chronic diseases.

8759,8759,12841,inheritance,Is Trisomy 18 inherited ?,"Is trisomy 18 inherited? Most cases of trisomy 18 are not inherited and occur randomly due to errors in the formation of eggs or sperm. If an egg or sperm gains an extra copy of chromosome 18 during cell division and contributes to a pregnancy, the embryo will have an extra chromosome 18 (trisomy) in each cell of the body. Mosaic trisomy 18 (when some body cells have trisomy 18 and some have a normal chromosome make-up), is also typically not inherited. Mosaic trisomy 18 is also due to an error in cell division, but the error occurs early in embryonic development. About 5% of affected people have a mosaic form of trisomy 18. Partial trisomy 18 (when only part of chromosome 18 is present in 3 copies) can be inherited. An unaffected parent can carry a rearrangement of genetic material between chromosome 18 and another chromosome. This rearrangement is called a balanced translocation because there is no extra or missing genetic material. However, a person with a balanced translocation has an increased risk with each pregnancy to have a child with trisomy 18.",184,": 

    Trisomy is a very important surgical procedure in some contexts. It can help to prevent an infection and help to save the lives of those who need the infection surgery. However, there is evidence to support the notion that Trisomy may not always be inherited by parents or other relatives. In this context, the treatment provided might not work very well if the problem goes untreated. For example, it might take time longer for a parent or person to start treating their child with the procedure again after the procedure. Therefore, it's important to consider the options and be open to hearing from caretakers, including parents and local health authorities.

8801,8801,12914,information,What is (are) Succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency ?,Succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH) deficiency is disorder that can cause a variety of neurological and neuromuscular problems. The signs and symptoms can be extremely variable among affected individuals and may include mild to severe intellectual disability; developmental delay (especially involving speech); hypotonia; difficulty coordinating movements (ataxia); and/or seizures. Some affected individuals may also have decreased reflexes (hyporeflexia); nystagmus; hyperactivity; and/or behavioral problems. SSADH deficiency is caused by mutations in the ALDH5A1 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Management is generally symptomatic and typically focuses on treating seizures and neurobehavioral issues.,93,": 

    Abstract:
Succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency is a metabolic disorder in the human body that occurs when cells deplete more rapidly than others. Due to the role of insulin in maintaining sugar production, individuals have low plasma levels of the enzyme glycanase-5 and have a reduced ability to produce ketone bodies.
In this brief article, here are some potential implications of succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency that are relevant to medical conditions (e.g. diabetes mellitus, high cholesterol, hypertension):

1. Metabolism: Succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency occurs in response to the depletion of sugar produced inside cells, leading to the degradation of glucose and consequently increased blood sugar regulation. The levels of fatty acids and lipids may have"
8802,8802,12916,causes,What causes Succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency ?,"What causes succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency? Succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency (SSADH) is caused by mutations in the ALDH5A1 gene. This gene provides instructions for producing the succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase enzyme which is involved in the breakdown of a chemical that transmits signals in the brain (neurotransmitter) called gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA). The primary role of GABA is to prevent the brain from being overloaded with too many signals. A shortage (deficiency) of succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase leads to an increase in the amount of GABA and a related molecule called gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) in the body, particularly the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system). It is unclear how an increase in GABA and GHB causes developmental delay, seizures, and other signs and symptoms of succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency.",127,":

The diagnosis of succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH) deficiency is based upon a thorough clinical exam, the identification of features consistent with the condition, and a variety of specialized tests. SSADH deficiency may first be suspected in late infancy or early childhood in individuals who have encephalopathy, a state in which brain function or structure is altered. The encephalopathy may be characterized by cognitive impairment; language deficit; poor muscle tone (hypotonia); seizures; decreased reflexes (hyporeflexia); and/or difficulty coordinating movements (ataxia). The diagnosis may be further suspected if urine organic acid analysis (a test that provides information about the substances the body discards through the urine) shows the presence of 4-hydroxybutyric acid. The diagnosis can be confirmed by an enzyme test showing deficiency of SSADH, or by genetic testing. ALDH5A1 is the only gene currently known to be associated with SSADH deficiency, and genetic testing can detect mutations in about 97% of affected individuals.",159,":

The exact cause of Cramp-fasciculation syndrome remains to be determined, but it is believed to be related to a degenerative neurological disorder known as a Migraine.

A diagnosis of cramp-fasciculation syndrome is generally based on the presence of characteristic signs and symptoms. Namely, a history of frequent muscle cramps, twitching, and pain (often worsened by exercise) without muscle weakness or wasting is suggestive of the condition. It is also important to rule out other conditions that may cause similar features. Electromyography (EMG) or repetitive nerve stimulation studies may also be done to assess the health of muscles and the nerves that control them. In repetitive nerve stimulation studies, muscle responses are recorded when the nerves are repetitively stimulated by small pulses of electricity.",102,":

       Explanation: Crampfasciculation syndrome is a condition in women who are having hormonal changes, such as hypothyroidism, which can result in low testosterone levels or persistent acne. Women may also experience symptoms such as tenderness in joint and shoulder pain, low blood pressure, or a change of consciousness or feeling of sadness. Research shows that over-the-counter medications may help improve symptoms of such conditions.

There is limited information in the medical literature about the treatment of cramp-fasciculation syndrome (CFS). Much of what is available describes individual cases. Some people with CFS improve without treatment. Treatment with carbamazepine, gabapentin, or pregabalin (medications that reduce the hyper-excitability of nerves) was described as helpful in improving symptoms in individual cases. Immunosuppressive therapy (e.g., prednisone) has been used to treat cases of CFS that did not respond to other treatments. For severe cases, additional treatment options may be considered. Decisions regarding treatment should be carefully considered and discussed with a knowledgeable healthcare provider.",101,":

Dominant dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DDEB) is caused by mutations in the COL7A1 gene. The COL7A1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is used to assemble type VII collagen. Collagen gives structure and strength to connective tissues, such as skin, tendons, and ligaments, throughout the body. Type VII collagen plays an important role in strengthening and stabilizing the skin. It is the main component of structures called anchoring fibrils, which anchor the top layer of skin, called the epidermis, to an underlying layer called the dermis. COL7A1 mutations alter the structure or disrupt the production of type VII collagen, which impairs its ability to help connect the epidermis to the dermis. When type VII collagen is abnormal or missing, friction or other minor trauma can cause the two skin layers to separate. This separation leads to the formation of blisters, which can cause extensive scarring as they heal. A diagram of the skin structure including the area of skin implicated in DDEB is provided by the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases.

    Abstract
 Achondroplasia is a rare disorder called oligodendroplasia which affects the shape of the adult body and its connective tissue in the lower jaw, abdomen and chin. It is believed to be caused by a genetic mutation that alters the normal shape of the adult body, which causes the body to become curvier.  
In general, it can affect the shape of the bones and teeth, as well as the muscles around the eyes and mouth. It can also lead to joint pain and may cause muscle tension and inflammation. Over time, the affected leg joints can suffer major changes, and the entire upper leg can become paralyzed and weakened.

If Dwarfism is the syndrome of low testosterone, it's an example of a hormonal difference that is not apparent to women.

To explain Dwarfism, consider the syndrome's characteristics. This involves low levels of testosterone and other hormones that are believed to impair the body’s ability to function with women, resulting in symptoms such as fatigue, acne, and muscle tension that may interfere with hormone function. In this case, it was observed that women with Dwarfism had an increased risk for developing certain symptoms such as fatigue, acne, and muscle tension.

The neural tube is a narrow channel that normally folds and closes between the 3rd and 4th weeks of pregnancy, forming the brain and spinal cord of the embryo. Anencephaly occurs when the 'cephalic' or head end of the neural tube fails to close, causing the absence of a major portion of the brain, skull, and scalp. Infants with this disorder are born without a forebrain (the front part of the brain) and a cerebrum (the thinking and coordinating part of the brain). The remaining brain tissue is often exposed (not covered by bone or skin). Affected babies are usually blind, deaf, unconscious, and unable to feel pain. Almost all babies with anencephaly die before birth, although some may survive a few hours or a few days after birth. Anencephaly is likely caused by an interaction between genetic and environmental factors, many of which remain unknown.",167,":

Like other forms of neural tube defects (NTDs), anencephaly is likely caused by the interaction of multiple genes and environmental factors, many of which remain unknown. Variations in many genes may influence the risk of developing anencephaly. The best-studied gene thus far is the MTHFR gene, which gives the body instructions to make a protein used to process the vitamin folate (also called vitamin B9). A deficiency of folate is a known risk factor for NTDs. Other genes involved in folate processing, and the development of the neural tube, may also affect the risk. Researchers have also looked at environmental factors that could contribute to the risk of anencephaly. Folate appears to play a significant role, and studies have shown that taking folic acid (a form of folate), before getting pregnant and very early in pregnancy, significantly reduces the risk to have a baby with a NTD. Other possible maternal risk factors for anencephaly include diabetes mellitus; obesity; exposure to high heat (such as a fever or use of a hot tub or sauna) in early pregnancy; and the use of certain anti-seizure medications during pregnancy.",198,":

Some researchers suspect that inflammation or chronic viral infection may play a role in the development of this condition.  Chandler's syndrome develops when the endothelium, the single layer of cells lining the inside of the surface of the cornea, fails to pump the aqueous humor from the cornea. This allows fluid to accumulate in the cornea (corneal edema), leading to blurred vision.",74,":

While it is not possible to halt the progression of Chandler's syndrome, the glaucoma associated with this disease can be treated with medications and/or filtering surgery. Eye drops used in managing glaucoma decrease pressure in the eye by helping the eye's fluid drain more efficiently and/or decreasing the amount of fluid made by the eye. Drugs used to treat glaucoma are classified according to their active ingredient. These include prostaglandin analogs, beta blockers, alpha agonists, and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. Combination drugs may be necessary for some patients. If these medications do not successfully treat the glaucoma, surgery may be indicated. Trabeculectomy may be used to treat glaucoma. In some cases, multiple procedures may be necessary. The corneal swelling associated with Chandler's syndrome may be treated through a cornea transplant. Further investigation is needed to determine the best way to manage this condition.",148,":

8964,8964,13229,information,What is (are) Mucopolysaccharidosis type I ?,"Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I) is a condition that affects many parts of the body. It is a progressively debilitating disorder; however, the rate of progression varies among affected individuals. MPS I is caused by mutations in the IDUA gene. These mutations lead to reduced levels or the complete lack of the IDUA enzyme. Without the proper amount of this enzyme, large sugar molecules called glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) accumulate within cells called lysosomes. This causes the lysosomes to increase in size, causing many different organs and tissues of the body to become enlarged. This leads to the medical problems seen in the condition.  MPS I was once divided into three separate syndromes: Hurler syndrome, Hurler-Scheie syndrome, and Scheie syndrome, listed from most to least severe. Because no biochemical differences have been identified and the clinical findings overlap, the condition is now divided into two subtypes, severe MPS I and attenuated MPS I. People with severe MPS I typically have an earlier onset of symptoms, a decline in intellectual function, and a shorter lifespan. Although there is no cure for MPS I, bone marrow transplant and enzyme replacement therapy are treatment options that may help manage the symptoms of this condition.",198,": 

    The Mucopolysaccharidosis type I disorder can be treated by medications, surgery, or combination therapy. The exact procedure depends on the specific patient and the available data. Some medications, such as antibiotics or statins, can be administered over a long period of time. In general, most medical professionals recommend that people with a Mucopolysaccharidosis type I disorder avoid certain medications and procedures. Other treatments, such as surgery and hypnosis, may also be helpful in managing this disorder.

The IDUA gene provides instructions for producing an enzyme that is involved in the breakdown of large sugar molecules called glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Mutations in the IDUA gene reduce or completely eliminate the function of the IDUA enzyme. The lack of IDUA enzyme activity leads to the accumulation of GAGs within cells, specifically inside the lysosomes. Lysosomes are compartments in the cell that digest and recycle different types of molecules. Conditions that cause molecules to build up inside the lysosomes, including MPS I, are called lysosomal storage disorders. The accumulation of GAGs increases the size of the lysosomes, which is why many tissues and organs are enlarged in this disorder.",123,": 

    Mucopolysaccharidosis type I is a genetic disorder causing a deficiency of the chloroplasts of several cells, including mitochondria. 
    
      Some cases of C. diff in Mucopolysaccharidosis type I occur by inhibiting a gene that controls oxidative phosphorylation of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation, which causes mitochondria to lose energy to complete repair of mitochondria and cause cellular respiration.

A drug called laronidase or Aldurazyme is the enzyme replacement therapy for MPS I. Treatment with laronidase can improve problems with breathing, growth, the bones, joints and heart. However, this treatment is not expected to treat problems with mental development because laronidase cannot cross the blood-brain barrier.

Leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter is a genetic condition caused by mutations in any of 5 genes - EIF2B1, EIF2B2, EIF2B3, EIF2B4, and EIF2B5. These genes give the body instructions to make the five parts (subunits) of a protein called eIF2B. This protein helps regulate overall production of protein in cells (protein synthesis). Proper regulation of protein synthesis ensures that the correct levels of protein are available for cells to cope with changing conditions and stress. Mutations in any of these 5 genes results in partial loss of eIF2B function, making it more difficult for cells to regulate protein synthesis and deal with changing conditions and stress. Researchers believe that cells in the white matter may be particularly affected by an abnormal response to stress, thus causing the signs and symptoms of this condition.

Treatment for leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter is supportive, aiming to alleviate symptoms. Management may include physical therapy and rehabilitation for motor dysfunction (mainly spasticity and ataxia); and anti-seizure medications for seizures. Infections and fevers should be prevented when possible through the use of vaccinations; low-dose maintenance antibiotics during winter months; antibiotics for minor infections; and antipyretics (fever-reducing medications) for fever. For children, wearing a helmet outside can help minimize the effects of head trauma. Contact sports, head trauma, and stressful situations (including high body temperature) should be avoided.

Parathyroid hormone helps control calcium, phosphorous, and vitamin D levels in the bones and blood. Hypoparathyroidism is a similar condition in which the body does not make enough parathyroid hormone instead of not being able to respond to it (as in pseudohypoparathyroidism). The symptoms of these two conditions are similar and are caused by low calcium levels and high phosphate levels in the blood. This may cause cataracts (clouding of the lens of the eye), dental problems, numbness, seizures, or tetany (muscle twitches and hand and foot spasms). These symptoms are usually first seen in childhood. There are two different types of pseudohypoparathyroidism, both of which are caused by spelling mistakes (mutations) in certain genes.

The diagnosis of diabetic mastopathy should be considered in patients with long-standing insulin-dependent diabetes and a firm, mobile breast mass. Initial imaging may include mammography and ultrasound. While these methods can help to further differentiate the mass, they cannot provide a specific diagnosis of diabetic mastopathy with confident exclusion of malignancy. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is unlikely to add additional information. Current practice dictates that a core biopsy (utilizing a needle to remove a small cylinder of tissue) be performed for a definitive diagnosis.  Biopsy results demonstrate lymphocytic lobulitis and ductitis, glandular atrophy (wasting), perivascular inflammation (vasculitis), dense keloid fibrosis (scarring), and epithelioid fibroblasts.",109,": 

    Diagnosing Diabetic Mastopathy  
Diagnosing Diabetic Mastopathy can be divided into three stages: disease emergence, treatment, and management. The first stage of disease manifestation can usually be identified by an examination of the testicles and small intestine, and can be achieved by using laboratory tests, laboratory techniques, and radiographic tests. The second stage of treatment includes the establishment of a medical management plan to reduce the risk of disease progression, as well as the management and support of family members in the treatment plan. However, treatment may also include lifestyle changes and further lifestyle adjustments to help manage the symptoms and potentially reverse the progression of disease. Management should include lifestyle changes such as regular exercise and dietary restrictions, avoiding processed eating and regular physical activity, improving nutrition and portion size, and reducing blood pressure and cholesterol levels.

9078,9078,13457,information,What is (are) Familial isolated hyperparathyroidism ?,"Familial isolated hyperparathyroidism (FIHP) is an inherited form of primary hyperparathyroidism that is not associated with other features. The age of diagnosis varies from childhood to adulthood. In FIHP, tumors involving the parathyroid glands cause the production and release of excess parathyroid hormone, which in turn causes increased calcium in the blood (hypercalcemia). The tumors are usually benign, but a cancerous tumor can develop in rare cases. Abnormal levels of calcium cause many of the symptoms of FIHP, including kidney stones, nausea, vomiting, high blood pressure (hypertension), weakness, and fatigue. Osteoporosis often also develops. FIHP may be caused by mutations in the MEN1, CDC73 (also known as the HRPT2 gene), or CASR genes and is typically inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. In some cases, the cause is unknown. Mutations in the MEN1 and CDC73 genes cause other conditions in which hyperparathyroidism is one of many features, but some people with mutations in these genes have only isolated hyperparathyroidism. FIHP can also represent an early stage of other syndromes. Treatment for FIHP often includes surgical removal of the affected gland(s).",180,":

Congenital radio-ulnar synostosis is caused by abnormal development of the forearm bones in the fetal period, although the underlying cause of the developmental abnormality is not always known. The condition may be isolated (occur without other abnormalities) or it may be associated with various other skeletal, cardiac (heart), neurologic, or gastrointestinal abnormalities. When other abnormalities are present, the condition may be due to an underlying genetic cause, including a variety of syndromes or chromosome abnormalities. In some cases, congenital radio-ulnar synostosis appears to be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. In an article published in 2000, the authors found that autosomal dominant radio-ulnar synostosis with amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia was caused by mutations in the HOXA11 gene in 2 families.",123,": 

    This is a case of Congenital Radio-ulnar Synostosis because the correct answer is a hypoventilation. When a patient has hypoventilation, your nerves and circulation become tense, leading to an increase in the rate of pumping through the airways. If you are hypomnephilic, you may experience pressure relief and even increase muscle contractions in the lower back and neck. This can cause a more rapid and intense contraction of your muscles, leading to muscle tenderness, joint pain, and inflammation. It's important to seek medical attention before attempting an operation and consulting with a medical professional if necessary.

Congenital radio-ulnar synostosis appears to be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner in some cases. This means that one mutated copy of the disease-causing gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. The mutated gene may occur for the first time in an affected individual, or it may be inherited from an affected parent. Each child of an individual with an autosomal dominant condition has a 50% (1 in 2) risk to inherit the mutated copy of the gene. Congenital radio-ulnar synostosis may also occur with a variety of other abnormalities and may be associated with a chromosome abnormality or genetic syndrome. In these cases, the inheritance pattern may depend upon that of the underlying genetic abnormality. Some genetic abnormalities that have been reported in association with this condition include Apert syndrome, Carpenter syndrome, arthrogryposis, Treacher Collins syndrome, Williams syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome, and Holt-Oram syndrome. Congenital radio-ulnar synostosis may also occur sporadically as an isolated abnormality, in which case the cause may be unknown.",172,":

Congenital radio-ulnar synostosis is a rare condition and is considered an autosomal recessive disorder. Congenital radio-ulnar synostosis has been classified as an autosomal recessive disorder, meaning that the genetic and environmental factors that affect transcription in the human immune system are the same for all the different versions of the disorder. In terms of its genetic inheritance, congenital radio-ulnar synostosis has resulted in different cell division rates, protein expression levels, and gene expression levels in the endoplasmic reticulum.

The severity varies and visual acuity can range from normal to legal blindness. About 20% of people with DOA have non-ocular features, such as sensorineural hearing loss; myopathy; peripheral neuropathy; multiple sclerosis-like illness; and spastic paraplegia (impaired function of the legs). These cases may be referred to as 'DOA plus.' DOA is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner and may be caused by a mutation in any of several genes, some of which have not been identified. There is currently no way to prevent or cure DOA, but affected people may benefit from low vision aids.",133,": 

    The answer is: Dominant optic atrophy.

Well, let's talk about Domant optic atrophy. Dominant optic atrophy refers to a phenomenon in which the optic nerve cells of a person's brain may exhibit extreme tension within the optic tissue and become numb or weak. In this condition, the nerve fibers or vessels in the optic nerve fibers are pulled in a negative direction towards each other to release tension, ultimately causing the brain to become numb or weak.

Dominant optic atrophy is a highly unusual condition and involves nerve cells in the optic nerve that are becoming tense and loose in their direction, potentially causing an upset of the optic nerve. A common cause of this condition is damage caused by nerve fibers in the surrounding tissue, especially in the face region. Symptoms of Dominant optic atrophy may include decreased balance,"

Cherished bone marrow contains hundreds of thousands of cells that convert their fat and sugar into nutrients and proteins, with an iron and phosphorus in their cells to support healthy growth and repair. All of this is important because it provides the living organisms with enough oxygen their body needs.

The papules appear in crops and may be mildly itchy. They may develop into blood or pus-filled blisters that break and form a crusty sore before healing completely. Lesions tend to spontaneously heal with or without scarring within 2-8 weeks of appearing.",77,": 

    From my knowledge cutoff, Lymphomatoid papulosis refers to a highly aggressive form of cancer. It was first discovered around the age of 15 in the United States and Europe. The diagnosis has caused significant concern in the past for the health of the public and families. Lymphomatoid papulosis is a common cancer that can cause inflammation, swelling, and tenderness when it moves around the body. To fully understand Lymphomatoid papulosis, it must be treated in a laboratory at a medical center.

This gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays a critical role in the formation of many organs and tissues before birth. It is a transcription factor, which means that it attaches (binds) to specific regions of DNA and helps control the activity of particular genes. Researchers believe that ZEB2 protein is involved in the development of tissues that give rise to the nervous system, digestive tract, facial features, heart, and other organs. Mowat-Wilson syndrome almost always results from the loss of one working copy of the ZEB2 gene in each cell. In some cases, the entire gene is deleted. In other cases, mutations within the gene lead to the production of an abnormally short, nonfunctional version of the ZEB2 protein. A shortage of this protein disrupts the normal development of many organs and tissues, which causes the varied signs and symptoms of Mowat-Wilson syndrome.",166,":

A diagnosis of olivopontocerebellar atrophy (OPCA) may be based on a thorough medical exam; the presence of signs and symptoms; imaging studies; various laboratory tests; and an evaluation of the family history. MRI of the brain may show characteristics of OPCA, such as specific changes in the size of affected parts of the brain. This is more likely as the disease progresses; it is possible to have OPCA and have a normal brain MRI (especially within the first year of symptom onset). Hereditary OPCA may be suspected based on having a family history, and may be diagnosed by genetic testing (when available) for the condition suspected or known to be present in the family. Sporadic OPCA may be diagnosed if hereditary forms of OPCA, and other conditions associated with OPCA, have been ruled out.",139,":

The pituitary gland normally makes several hormones (including growth hormone, thyroid stimulating hormone, adrenocorticotropic hormone, prolactin, follicle stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone, vasopressin, and oxytocin).  These hormones are important for directing body growth and development, and for regulating blood pressure and metabolism.  Symptoms of this condition vary and depend on which hormones are affected.  Treatment depends on the cause of this condition; once the cause is corrected, medication (hormone replacement therapy) must be taken to provide the body with the normal amount of hormones.",100,":

9176,9176,13653,inheritance,Is Abetalipoproteinemia inherited ?,"How is abetalipoproteinemia inherited? Abetalipoproteinemia is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. This means that to be affected, a person must have a mutation in both copies of the responsible gene in each cell. Affected people inherit one mutated copy of the gene from each parent, who is referred to as a carrier. Carriers of an autosomal recessive condition typically do not have any signs or symptoms (they are unaffected). When 2 carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has a: 25% (1 in 4) chance to be affected 50% (1 in 2) chance to be an unaffected carrier like each parent 25% chance to be unaffected and not be a carrier",115,":

    Overview 
The development of Abetalipoprotein A (ABA) and other pathogenic plaques can have major implications for healthcare, disease prevention, and other populations worldwide. Abetalipoproteinemia (ABE) comes from the process of beta plaques made in blood vessels, including lymph nodes, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), spleen, and pancreas. Some diseases, however, can also have the effect of abetalipoprotein A disease, such as liver cirrhosis and myeloma, which are the most common forms of liver cancer. Abetalipoproteinemia is defined as anemia in which plaque accumulation can lead to the formation of a large range of red blood cells. This type of abetalipoprotein A disease is often considered a rare condition"

A nutritionist or other qualified medical professional should be consulted for specific dietary instruction in people with abetalipoproteinemia. Treatment involves very large doses of vitamin E, as well as large doses of vitamin supplements containing other fat-soluble vitamins (vitamin A, vitamin D, and vitamin K). Linoleic acid supplements are also recommended. Several diet changes and/or restrictions are also needed to prevent stomach problems. A low-fat diet may help with digestive symptoms; medium chain triglycerides may be used (under supervision of a specialist) as a source of fat in the diet. Management in adults typically focuses on specific complications associated with the disorder, and depends on the signs and symptoms present. Affected people may need consultations with several other types of specialists, including a lipidologist, gastroenterologist, hepatologist, ophthalmologist, and neurologist.",134,": 

    The Treatment Strategy 
First, research on Abetalipoproteinemia is crucial for identifying ways to mitigate its effects. Key research topics include cognitive decline, cognitive impairments, sleep disturbance, and chronic disease. In this type of condition, the process may not significantly improve cognitive function or reduce stress. In contrast, medications are effective at reducing Abetalipoproteinemia symptoms, and therefore they can reduce the frequency and duration of sleep irregularities. Finally, treatments have the potential to be cost-effective, but the cost is often very high. Therefore, it has been suggested that treating Abetalipoproteinemia is an achievable goal based on their costs and potential benefits.

This therapy has been successful in preventing attacks of fever in 75 percent of those who take the drug regularly. Over 90 percent of people with FMF demonstrate a marked improvement. Even if colchicine does not prevent the fever attacks, it does prevent the amyloidosis. However, compliance in taking colchicine every day is very important. If a person stops taking the drug, an attack can occur within a few days. Complications of colchicine use can also occur and include muscle weakness (myopathy) and a toxic epidermal necrolysis-like reaction.

    In plasma cell leukemia, the normal function of cells in the lymphatic system and bone marrow remains intact. However, the cells that are immune to lymphomas produce negative immunoglobulins (NIGs) capable of causing tumors. This leads to the accumulation of immune cells and is usually accompanied by an increased risk of cancer, such as lymphoblastic leukemia. There is no currently available evidence of an immune response to this condition. However, a variety of treatments and biologic therapy that is currently available on the market can significantly contribute to the prevention of these cancers.

The symptoms can vary greatly; some individuals may not show symptoms, while others may experience progressive difficulty breathing and shortness of breath upon exertion. Other signs and symptoms may include a dry, chronic cough; fatigue; weight loss; chest pain; and a general feeling of ill health. In rare cases, the coughing up of blood, rounding and swelling of the tips of the fingers, and cyanosis may be present. Most cases occur for no known reason, but some cases may occur secondary to environmental exposures or underlying diseases; some researchers believe it may be an autoimmune disorder.

In some cases, the procedure may need to be performed once; in others it may need to be repeated many times over several years. In secondary PAP (due to environmental exposure or an underlying disorder), removal and avoidance of the causative agent (e.g., silica exposure) or treatment of the underlying disorder may improve symptoms. Inhaled GM-CSF (granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor), a blood-stimulating medication, has been shown to improve the condition in some individuals with PAP.

Others believe it develops like a tumor, caused by cells growing and multiplying more quickly than usual. The association between a history of trauma and the development of  PVNS is unclear. One study found that 56% of individuals with PVNS had a history of previous trauma, while other studies have found a much lower incidence.

Gene therapy is a technique which helps to break free from a faulty gene and allow for more control over cell growth and function. The process involves exposing the cells to a genetically advantageous environment where they will have more energy and tissue elasticity. In some cases, gene therapy can also be used to replace certain hereditary features of the cell to make it more resistant to disease. 
    
       Treatment for Chromosome 3p- syndrome can vary greatly. It can be done via IV fluids, over a period of hours, or even for only a few hours each day. In some cases, it can also be used to improve tissue strength, reduce inflammation and even improve blood clotting. In addition, treatments"

The mainstay of treatment for IVL is surgery to remove the tumor and its spread throughout the body. The use of anti-estrogen therapy, such as tamoxifen, has also been suggested. Surgery requires the complete removal of the tumor, since incomplete removal may result in a recurrence and hence further surgery or even death. Many affected individuals undergo a hysterectomy; bilateral oophorectomy is also suggested because these tumors are estrogen dependent. Part of a tumor left inside the pelvic veins at the time of hysterectomy can extend towards the right side of the heart, leading to obstruction and other adverse events later in life. The median time between hysterectomy to the diagnosis of IVL with cardiac involvement is 4 years. Once there is cardiac involvement, a patient may require open-heart surgery to remove the IVL from the affected areas.",144,":

Hypophosphatemic rickets is almost always hereditary and may be caused by mutations in any of several genes. The specific gene involved determines the way it is inherited. Most commonly, it is caused by a mutation in the PHEX gene. Other genes that can be responsible for the condition include the CLCN5, DMP1, ENPP1, FGF23, and SLC34A3 genes. The genes associated with hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets are involved in keeping a proper balance of phosphate in the body. Many of these genes directly or indirectly regulate a protein that normally inhibits the kidneys' ability to reabsorb phosphate into the blood. Mutations affecting the function of these genes increase the production (or reduce the breakdown) of the protein, causing the protein to be overactive. The overactivity of the protein reduces phosphate reabsorption by the kidneys, leading to the features of the condition. Rarer, sporadic, acquired cases are sometimes associated with benign (non-cancerous) mesenchymal tumors that decrease resorption of phosphate.",160,": 

    The answer to Hypophosphatemic rickets due to poor diet, poor exercise, stress or boredom may be due to excessive stress or an underlying genetic predisposition, which can lead to an increased risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease.

9258,9258,13798,inheritance,Is Hypophosphatemic rickets inherited ?,"How is hypophosphatemic rickets inherited? Hypophosphatemic rickets is most often inherited in an X-linked dominant manner. This means that the gene responsible for the condition is located on the X chromosome, and having only one mutated copy of the gene is enough to cause the condition. Because males have only one X chromosome (and one Y chromosome) and females have two X chromosomes, X-linked dominant conditions affect males and females differently. Both males and females can have an X-linked dominant condition. However, because males don't have a second, working copy of the gene (as females do), they usually have more severe disease than females. If a father has the mutated X-linked gene: all of his daughters will inherit the mutated gene (they will all receive his X chromosome) none of his sons will inherit the mutated gene (they only inherit his Y chromosome) If a mother has the mutated X-linked gene, each of her children (both male and female) has a 50% chance to inherit the mutated gene. Less commonly, hypophosphatemic rickets is inherited in an X-linked recessive, autosomal dominant, or autosomal recessive manner.",184,":

X-linked adrenal hypoplasia congenita is caused by mutations in the NR0B1 gene. The NR0B1 gene provides instructions to make a protein called DAX1. This protein plays an important role in the development and function of several hormone-producing tissues including the adrenal glands, two hormone-secreting glands in the brain (the hypothalamus and pituitary), and the gonads (ovaries in females and testes in males). The hormones produced by these glands control many important body functions. Some NR0B1 mutations result in the production of an inactive version of the DAX1 protein, while other mutations delete the entire gene. The resulting shortage of DAX1 disrupts the normal development and function of hormone-producing tissues in the body. The signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism occur when endocrine glands do not produce the right amounts of certain hormones.",141,":

9264,9264,13808,inheritance,Is X-linked adrenal hypoplasia congenita inherited ?,"How is X-linked adrenal hypoplasia congenita inherited? X-linked adrenal hypoplasia congenita is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern. A condition is considered X-linked if the mutated gene that causes the disorder is located on the X chromosome, one of the two sex chromosomes. In males (who have only one X chromosome), one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. In females (who have two X chromosomes), a mutation must be present in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. Males are affected by X-linked recessive disorders much more frequently than females. A characteristic of X-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass X-linked traits to their sons. In X-linked recessive inheritance, a female with one mutated copy of the gene in each cell is called a carrier. She can pass on the altered gene, but usually does not experience signs and symptoms of the disorder. In rare cases, however, females who carry a NR0B1 mutation may experience adrenal insufficiency or signs of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism such as underdeveloped reproductive tissues, delayed puberty, and an absence of menstruation.",184,": 

    This question appears to be about X-linked adrenal hyperplasia congenita (XAD).  An XAD is a genetic disorder that affects the adrenal system, which produces strong adrenal hormones. XAD has been associated with increased risk of various health problems such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. In general, XAD can have serious consequences, including reduced blood pressure and a reduced life expectancy. Although XAD can also result in genetic damage, it can be treated with medications that have anti-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory properties.

Birth defects associated with fetal retinoid syndrome include: hydrocephalus, microcephaly, intellectual disabilities, ear and eye abnormalities, cleft palate and other facial differences, and heart defects. Isotretinoin can cause these birth defects in the early weeks of pregnancy, even before a woman knows that she is pregnant.",84,":

Autosomal recessive Robinow syndrome causes shortening of the long bones in the arms and legs; short fingers and toes; wedge-shaped spinal bones leading to kyphoscoliosis; fused or missing ribs; short stature; and distinctive facial features. Other features may include underdeveloped genitalia; dental problems; kidney or heart defects; or delayed development. This form is caused by mutations in the ROR2 gene. Autosomal dominant Robinow syndrome causes more mild, but similar, features. There are rarely spine and rib abnormalities, and short stature is less severe. A variant type of this form is additionally characterized by osteosclerosis. Autosomal dominant Robinow syndrome may be caused by a mutation in the WNT5A or DVL1 gene.

While people with UHS often report a negative family history, the characteristic hair shaft abnormality seen in affected people can still be seen in unaffected family members by looking at their hair under a specific type of microscope.",160,": 

    The exact answer to the question is neither definitive nor accurate. It is difficult for me to provide any kind of definitive answer and would depend on several factors such as genetic and environmental factors.

A diagnosis of uncombable hair syndrome (UHS) is made by observing the characteristic symptoms of the condition, as well observing the hair shaft under a special microscope. When the individual hair strands are viewed under a microscope, the hair is either triangular or kidney-shaped on cross section, and has a canal-like longitudinal groove along one or two faces. People with concerns about symptoms of UHS are encouraged to speak with their dermatologist about being evaluated for this condition.",84,":

Gentle hair care is generally recommended using conditioners and soft brushes, along with avoiding harsh hair treatments such as permanent waves (perms); chemical relaxants; or excessive brushing and blow drying. These strategies may improve the general manageability of the hair, although how well they work is subjective. Another strategy that has been suggested to improve the appearance of the hair is the use of biotin supplements. One case report suggested significant improvement in hair strength and combability, with an increase in rate of growth after 4 months of supplementation.",120,":

Cholestasis is a condition that impairs the release of bile (a digestive juice) from liver cells. The bile then builds up in the liver, impairing liver function. Symptoms typically become apparent in the third trimester of pregnancy and can include severe itching (pruritus). Occasionally, the skin and the whites of the eyes can have a yellow appearance (jaundice). ICP is additionally associated with risks to the developing baby such as premature delivery and stillbirth. The cause of ICP is largely unknown, although approximately 15% of cases are caused by mutations in either the ABCB11 or ABCB4 genes. Mutations within the ABCB11 and ABCB4 genes are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Symptoms of ICP are typically limited to pregnancy. Bile flow returns to normal after delivery and the signs and symptoms of the condition disappear, however, they can return during later pregnancies.",159,":

Largely, the cause of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) is unknown. ICP is present in approximately 1% of pregnancies in the United States. It is thought to be caused by a mixture of genetic, hormonal, and environmental factors. Risk factors include: A personal or family history of cholestasis of pregnancy A history of liver disease A multiple gestation pregnancy (twins, triplets, etc) Approximately 15% of women with ICP have a mutation in either the ABCB11 orABCB4 gene. Mutations within these genes increase the likelihood that a woman will develop ICP. Mutations within the ABCB11 and ABCB4 gene(s) are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. This means that in order to be affected, a person only needs a change in one copy of the responsible gene in each cell. In some cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from an affected parent. Other cases may result from new (de novo) mutations within the gene. A person with a mutation in either theABCB11 or ABCB4 gene has a 50% chance with each pregnancy of passing along the altered gene to his or her child.",188,":

Sedating antihistamines such as hydroxyzine may also be helpful for pruritus, especially at night. Some improvement has been reported with high doses of vitamin A, with or without vitamin E. Topical retinoic acid cream may also improve the symptoms. Another approach to treatment uses oral retinoids, which resulted in alleviation of symptoms in one study. Etretinate in high doses is also reportedly effective, but relapse has been reported following discontinuation of therapy. UV light therapy is reportedly particularly helpful for individuals with widespread lesions or coexisting pruritus from renal or hepatic disease.

    In Kyrle disease, the most common treatment is hormone therapy. In this treatment, hormone therapy helps to maintain healthy hormone levels, which can help prevent inflammation and other health problems.

    
    In Kyrle disease, hormone therapy can be done by injection, and is usually done without a prescription. The medications used in this treatment are usually low-dose aspirin, acetaminophen, olanzapine, and nevirapine.

    
    
     In Kyrle disease, in severe cases, a combination of these medications may be necessary. For example, olanzapine used to treat severe heartburn could be combined with olanzapine for a life-saving approach.

The deletion occurs near the middle of the chromosome at a location designated q11.2. Most people with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome are missing a piece of the chromosome that contains about 30 to 40 genes, many of which have not been well characterized. Some affected people have smaller deletions. Researchers are working to learn more about all of the genes that contribute to the features of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. The deletion of a particular gene, TBX1, is probably responsible for many of the syndrome's characteristic signs (such as heart defects, a cleft palate, distinctive facial features, hearing loss, and low calcium levels). Loss of this gene may also contribute to behavioral problems. The loss of another gene, COMT, may also cause increased risk of behavioral problems and mental illness in affected people. The other genes that are deleted likely contribute to the various features of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome.",170,":

Most cases of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome are not inherited from a parent and are caused by a random error during the formation of egg or sperm cells, or during early fetal development. In about 10% of cases, the deletion is inherited from a parent with the deletion. All people with the deletion, whether they inherited it or not, can pass the deletion to their children. The inheritance pattern is autosomal dominant because having a deletion in only one copy of chromosome 22 in each cell is enough to cause signs and symptoms. Each child of a person with the deletion has a 50% (1 in 2) chance to inherit the deletion.",116,":

This gene encodes growth hormone receptor, which is a protein found on the outer membrane of cells throughout the body. Growth hormone receptor is designed to recognize and bind growth hormone, which triggers cellular growth and division. When growth hormone is bound to the growth hormone receptors on liver cells, specifically, insulin-like growth factor I (another important growth-promoting hormone) is produced. Mutations in GHR impair the function of growth hormone receptors which interferes with their ability to bind growth hormone. This disrupts normal growth and development of cells and prevents the production of insulin-like growth factor I which causes the many signs and symptoms of Laron syndrome.",122,":

If von Willebrand factor does not function normally or too little of the protein is available, blood clots cannot form properly. VWF gene mutations that reduce the amount of von Willebrand factor or cause the protein to function abnormally (or not at all) are responsible for the signs and symptoms associated with the condition.

People with this condition cannot break down the sugars sucrose (a sugar found in fruits, and also known as table sugar) and maltose (the sugar found in grains). CSID usually becomes apparent after an infant begins to consume fruits, juices, and grains. After ingestion of sucrose or maltose, an affected child will typically experience stomach cramps, bloating, excess gas production, and diarrhea. These digestive problems can lead to failure to thrive and malnutrition. Most affected children are better able to tolerate sucrose and maltose as they get older. CSID is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern and is caused by mutations in the SI gene.",122,":

CSID can be diagnosed through clinical evaluation, detailed patient history, and tolerance lab tests. Blood tests can be done to look for a flat serum glucose curve after patients are given a dose of sucrose. In addition, blood and urine samples may test positive for sucrose, maltose, or palatinose (a form of maltose) if used during tolerance testing. The feces may also show sucrose, glucose, and fructose, and an acid pH level of below 5.0 or 6.0.  CSID can be confirmed by taking a small sample of tissue (biopsy) from the small intestine and measuring the activity of the enzyme called sucrase-isomaltase. Other tests may include a sucrose hydrogen breath test in which an abnormally high level of hydrogen will be detected in the breath of an affected individual after sucrose ingestion.",139,":

The HTT gene mutation that causes HD involves a DNA segment known as a CAG trinucleotide repeat. This segment is made up of three DNA building blocks that repeat multiple times in a row. The CAG segment in a normal HTT gene repeats about 10 to 35 times. In people with HD, it may repeat from 36 to over 120 times. People with 36 to 39 CAG repeats (an intermediate size) may or may not develop HD, while people with 40 or more repeats almost always develop HD. An increased number of CAG repeats leads to an abnormally long version of the huntingtin protein. The long protein is then cut into smaller, toxic pieces that end up sticking together and accumulating in neurons. This disrupts the function of the neurons, ultimately causing the features of HD.",184,":

    The Microscopic Polyangiitis disease (MOP) is a respiratory illness caused by a common microorganism of the skin called microcolitis, causing anemia, skin eruption, rash, and congestion in the chest. It is most common in children, adults, and older people.

   A common complication is skin rash, which occurs when microorganisms on the skin react differently to the presence or absence of other irritants such as smoke, alcohol, or soap. It can be caused by bacteria, fungi, or other sources of microorganisms, especially small animals or tiny microorganisms.

    Microscopic Polyangiitis can require treatment in small amounts, and it is not uncommon for individuals to experience this condition over time.

There are a variety of immune suppressing medications that are used in MPA; however, resources state that a steroid (usually prednisone) and a medication toxic to cells (usually starting with cyclophosphamide) are typically prescribed first. The goal of treatment is to stop all of the organ damage that occurs as a result of MPA.  The duration of treatment with immune suppressing medication varies between individuals, but is typically given for at least one to two years.",102,": 

    There are several different methods for treating microscopic polyangiitis. Firstly, you can perform a simple surgery to remove a swollen or discolored disc. This can be done using surgical instruments such as bandages or a saline-based ointment. Alternatively, you can use a combination of surgical operations and radiation treatments that work together to reduce swelling and discoloration. If you are unable to successfully complete this operation, you may need to take a rest or cancel the application of chemotherapy to reduce swelling and discoloration. In the case of microscopic polyangiitis, you should consult with a healthcare professional to identify and treat the specific factors that are causing the swelling and discoloration that are causing discomfort and distress.

        Hallermann-Streiff syndrome is a genetic disorder caused by an inborn abnormality in the endoplasmic reticulum. In people with Hallermann-Streiff syndrome, the extraocular vision and blurred vision in the eyes may result from the defective gene regulation of the perioprotein complex or chromosome 14.  
       Hallermann-Streiff syndrome can also cause nerve damage, including damage to nerves associated with pain or discomfort. 
       Additionally, some people with the syndrome may have nerve problems or be more prone to serious complications in everyday life.

These genes provide instructions for making proteins that are found in liver cells, where they transport bilirubin and other substances from the blood into the liver so that they can be cleared from the body. In the liver, bilirubin is dissolved in a digestive fluid called bile, and then excreted from the body. The mutations in the SLCO1B1 and SLCO1B3 genes that cause Rotor syndrome either prevent the production of the transporting proteins, or prevent them from functioning properly. When this occurs, bilirubin is not effectively removed from the body and builds up, leading to jaundice.",117,":

People with Rotor syndrome have a buildup of both in their blood (hyperbilirubinemia), but having elevated levels of conjugated bilirubin is the hallmark of the disorder. Conjugated bilirubin in affected people is usually more than 50% of total bilirubin. To confirm a disgnosis of Rotor syndrome, a person may have the following performed: testing for serum bilirubin concentration testing for bilirubin in the urine testing for hemolysis and liver enzyme activity (to rule out other conditions) cholescintigraphy (also called an HIDA scan) testing for total urinary porphyrins",137,":

For example, we could try to see if there is a difference in how it changes over time, or if it seems to work better for certain situations rather than others.

The treatments for Rotor syndrome are usually pain management, surgery, and medications. Treatment may include medications like anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids, anticholinergic medications, or antidepressants.

The clinical symptoms of hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis - Dutch type are caused by the build-up of a protein called amyloid within the arterial walls of the brain. This protein build-up causes bleeding into the brain. The symptoms occur because bleeding in the brain harms brain tissue. Hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis-Dutch type is an autosomal dominant disorder with complete penetrance (all individuals who inherit the mutated gene will develop the condition).

A condition is X-linked if the responsible gene is located on the X chromosome. The inheritance is dominant if having only one changed (mutated) copy of the responsible gene is enough to cause symptoms of the condition. In women who carry an FMR1 gene premutation (approximately 55 to 200 CGG repeats), the repeats can expand to more than 200 repeats in their cells that develop into eggs. This means that women with a premutation (or a full mutation) have an increased risk to have a child with FXS. The size of the risk corresponds to the number of CGG repeats they have. By contrast, men with premutations are not at risk for the repeats expanding to over 200 when passing the gene to offspring. However, men with a premutation will pass the premutation on to all of their daughters and none of their sons. This is because boys receive only a Y chromosome from their fathers.",173,":

Chromosomal studies have found that Ewing sarcoma cells are often characterized by an abnormal change in their genetic makeup known as a reciprocal translocation. The most common mutation, occurring in approximately 85% of Ewing sarcoma tumors, involves two genes, the EWSR1 gene on chromosome 22 and the FLI1 gene on chromosome 11. This rearrangement of genetic material between chromosomes 22 and 11 fuses part of the EWSR1 gene with part of the FLI1 gene, creating the EWSR1/FLI1 fusion gene. This mutation is acquired during a person's lifetime and is present only in tumor cells. This type of genetic change, called a somatic mutation, is not inherited. In extremely rare cases, Ewing sarcoma may develop as a second malignancy, which means that the condition develops as a late-onset complication of earlier treatment for another form of cancer.",149,": 

    The reason behind Ewing sarcoma is due to a genetic mutation which causes Ewing to produce muscle fibers that are too long to hold and therefore is too weak for proper muscle alignment. 
   
    While it is generally believed that Ewing sarcoma could affect the cardiovascular system, genetic mutations can still produce muscle fibers for an extended period of time. 
   
    The reason for this difference is that a genetic mutation can result in a weakened muscular system, making the muscle fibers inadequate for proper alignment and alignment of the entire body. 
   
    With a genetic mutation, Ewing sarcoma can become more pronounced and severe, leading to a more pronounced muscle alignment than is usually necessary. "

In people with multiple myeloma, excess plasma cells form tumors in the bone, causing bones to become weak and easily broken. The abnormal growth of plasma cells also makes it more difficult for the bone marrow to make healthy blood cells and platelets. The plasma cells produced in multiple myeloma produce abnormal antibodies that the immune system is unable to use. These abnormal antibodies build up in the body and cause a variety of problems.

In some cases, Fuchs dystrophy appears to be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. When this condition is caused by a mutation in the COL8A2 gene (which is the early-onset form of the disease), it is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. In addition, an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern is seen in some situations in which the condition is caused by changes in an unknown gene. However, in many cases, the inheritance pattern is unknown. Some cases result from new mutations in a gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.

9664,9664,14527,causes,What causes GM1 gangliosidosis ?,"What causes GM1 gangliosidosis? All three types of GM1 gangliosidosis are caused by mutations (changes) in the GLB1 gene. This gene gives the body instructions to make an enzyme called beta-galactosidase (-galactosidase), which plays an important role in the brain. The enzyme resides in compartments within cells called lysosomes, where it helps break down certain molecules, including a substance called GM1 ganglioside. GM1 ganglioside is important for nerve cell function in the brain. Mutations in the GLB1 gene may lower or eliminate the activity of the -galactosidase enzyme, keeping GM1 ganglioside from being broken down. As a result, it accumulates to toxic levels in tissues and organs, particularly in the brain. This accumulation leads to the destruction of nerve cells, causing the features of the condition. In general, people with higher enzyme activity levels usually have milder features than those with lower activity levels.",144,":

Males with Denys-Drash syndrome have gonadal dysgenesis, a condition in which the external genitalia do not look clearly male or clearly female (ambiguous genitalia) or the genitalia appear to be completely female. The testes are also undescended, meaning that they remain in the pelvis, abdomen, or groin. Affected females usually have normal genitalia.

This gene provides instructions for making a protein (the WT1 protein) that regulates the activity of other genes by attaching (binding) to specific regions of DNA. The WT1 protein plays a role in the development of the kidneys and gonads (ovaries in females and testes in males) before birth. The WT1 gene mutations that cause Denys-Drash syndrome lead to the production of an abnormal protein that cannot bind to DNA. As a result, the activity of certain genes is unregulated, which impairs the development of the kidneys and reproductive organs. Abnormal development of these organs leads to diffuse glomerulosclerosis (where scar tissue forms throughout glomeruli, the tiny blood vessels in the kidney that filter waste from blood) and gonadal dysgenesis, which are characteristic features of Denys-Drash syndrome. The abnormal gene activity caused by the loss of normal WT1 protein also increases the risk of developing Wilms tumor in affected individuals.",164,":

The treatment varies depending on the location of the meningioma and the symptoms caused by the tumor. Careful observation is sometimes the best course of action for people with a meningioma. When treatment is necessary, surgery and radiation are the most common forms of treatment. Radiation may be used if the meningioma cannot be operated on or if the meningioma is only partially removed by surgery. Radiation may also be used in cases of malignant, atypical, or recurrent tumors. Other treatments that have been tried or are being explored include hydroxyurea, epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors, platelet-derived growth factor receptor inhibitors, vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors, immunotherapy to stimulate the immune system, and somatostatin analogs which prevent the release of growth hormones.",127,":

This gene provides instructions for making a protein called atrophin 1. Although the function of atrophin 1 is unclear, it likely plays an important role in nerve cells (neurons) in many areas of the brain. The ATN1 mutation that causes DRPLA involves a DNA segment known as a CAG trinucleotide repeat. This segment is made up of a series of three DNA building blocks (cytosine, adenine, and guanine) that appear multiple times in a row on the gene. Normally, this CAG segment is repeated 6 to 35 times within the ATN1 gene. In people with DRPLA, the CAG segment is repeated at least 48 times (and sometimes much more). The abnormally long CAG trinucleotide repeat changes the structure of the atrophin 1 protein, which then accumulates in neurons and interferes with normal cell functions. The dysfunction and eventual death of these neurons lead to the signs and symptoms associated with DRPLA.",166,":

Treatment for hemochromatosis might include phlebotomy, iron chelation therapy, dietary changes, and treatment for complications.The goal of treatment is to reduce the amount of iron in the body to normal levels, prevent or delay organ damage from excess iron, treat complications of hemochromatosis, and maintain normal amounts of iron throughout the lifetime. Phlebotomy aids in ridding the body of excess iron and maintaining normal iron stores. Most people begin treatment with weekly therapeutic phlebotomy of 500 mL whole blood-although sometimes treatment is initially twice a week. Maintenance phlebotomy usually involves treatment every 2-3 weeks in which 1 unit of blood is removed.

Non-classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency (NCAH) is caused by changes (mutations) in the CYP21A2 gene. This gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called 21-hydroxylase, which is found in the adrenal glands. The adrenal glands are cone-shaped organs that sit on top of the kidneys and are responsible for releasing various types of hormones that the body needs to function. Mutations in CYP21A2 lead to deficient levels of 21-hydroxylase which cause low levels of hormones such as cortisol and/or aldosterone and an overproduction of androgens (male hormones such as testosterone). Cortisol is a hormone that affects energy levels, blood sugar levels, blood pressure, and the body's response to stress, illness, and injury. Aldosterone helps the body maintain the proper level of sodium (salt) and water and helps maintain blood pressure. Irregular levels of these hormones lead to the signs and symptoms of NCAH. The amount of functional 21-hydroxylase enzyme determines the severity of the disorder. People with NCAH have CYP21A2 mutations that result in the production of reduced amounts of the enzyme, but more enzyme than the classic form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia.",196,":

9769,9769,14718,causes,What causes Cowden syndrome ?,"What causes Cowden syndrome? Most cases of Cowden syndrome are caused by changes (mutations) in the PTEN gene. PTEN is a tumor suppressor gene which means that it encodes a protein that helps keep cells from growing and dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way. Mutations in PTEN result in a defective protein that is unable to carry out its normal role. This leads to the development of the various tumors and cancers associated with Cowden syndrome. Rarely, Cowden syndrome is caused by mutations in KLLN, SDHB, SDHC, SDHD, PIK3CA or AKT1. Some affected families have no identifiable mutation in any of the genes associated with Cowden syndrome; in these families, the exact underlying cause is unknown.",118,": 

    A possible cause of Cowden syndrome may involve hereditary changes in immune responses, as well as genetic predispositions, such as high risk or asexuality.
    

   We understand that Cowden syndrome is caused by many genetic factors, so it is important to understand, diagnose, and consider any potential risk factors before continuing to practice veterinary medicine.
    
    
     On the same level, we are also encouraged that it is possible that hereditary changes in our immune system can be caused by an imbalance of gene expression or other genetic abnormalities.

    Answer: 
    The treatment provided with the test is appropriate for Uracuchia and allows the risk of ovarian cysts, which can occur with Urachal cancer. Additionally, a controlled trial is an effective way to reduce the risk of ovarian cysts, while further monitoring and follow-up should not be relied on as treatments.

    Abstract: 
Book Syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by the development of an abnormal or overactive immune system. This disorder arises from genetic differences between the parents of a child with books to read in their minds, and may affect their cognitive abilities. 
   
To explain Book Syndrome, we can look at the following criteria. 

1. Reading is an essential function of an autoimmune system to protect the body from infection 
2. Loved ones who read are more likely to learn a new language 
3. Bookworms are often infected 
4. Bookworms, also known as virus-eaters, are microscopic, microorganisms that eat food and contain a protein called chondroitin

To our knowledge, Book syndrome has only been reported in one, large Swedish family (25 cases in 4 generations) and in one other isolated case. In the Swedish family, the syndrome was inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. In autosomal dominant inheritance, having a mutation in only one copy of the responsible gene is enough to cause signs and symptoms of the condition. When a person with an autosomal dominant condition has children, each child has a 50% (1 in 2) risk to inherit the mutated copy of the gene.",95,": 

    The presence of Book syndrome in the human brain can be inherited from a wide range of factors, including genetic predisposition, gene expression, environmental influences, and environment.    It is thought that Book syndrome is present in a wide variety of human populations and is influenced by multiple genes, lifestyle, and even an individual's individual susceptibility to certain environmental conditions.    This in turn can lead to significant variation in brain size, volume, and ability to perform tasks that require attention.    The potential to learn about these differences through experience is a natural process for learning to adapt to new life circumstances, and it is one of the first steps in providing personalized treatment options for individuals with Book Syndrome.

Due to the rarity of Book syndrome and scarcity of reports in the medical literature, we are unaware of specific information about diagnosing Book syndrome. In general, ectodermal dysplasias are diagnosed by the presence of specific symptoms affecting the hair, nails, sweat glands, and/or teeth. When a person has at least two types of abnormal ectodermal features (e.g., malformed teeth and extremely sparse hair), the person is typically identified as being affected by an ectodermal dysplasia. Specific genetics tests to diagnose ectodermal dysplasia are available for only a limited number of ectodermal dysplasias. Unfortunately, there currently is no genetic test for Book syndrome because the gene responsible for the condition has not yet been identified. People who are interested in learning more about a diagnosis of ectodermal dysplasia for themselves or family members should speak with their dermatologist and/or dentist. These specialists can help determine whether a person has signs and/or symptoms of ectodermal dysplasia.",160,":

    It is important to note that Serpiginous choroiditis (SCH) is a rare, progressive bacterial infection, often characterized by bright whites or pustules in the surface of the eye. Symptoms of SCH tend to be milder and typically show little to no swelling or abnormally thickened bilirubin.

    Symptoms of SCH can range from mild cramping to cramping, which may not last long and may require periodic rest or medication. However, a combination of medications and appropriate treatment (such as IV or laser therapy) can be necessary to alleviate symptoms and improve overall health and overall well-being.

In females, disease traits resulting from the abnormal copy of a gene on one X chromosome can be 'masked' by the normal copy of the gene on the other X chromosome. Because only one functioning X chromosome is required in males and females, one of the X chromosomes in each cell of a female is essentially 'turned off,' usually in a random pattern (X chromosome inactivation). Therefore, if the X chromosome with the gene mutation is activated in some cells, female carriers may have some mild features of the disorder.

Patients are highly susceptible to infection and develop fungal, bacterial, and viral infections typical of SCID. In this syndrome, the SCID is associated with low IgG, IgA, and IgM and the virtual absence of B cells. There is an elevated number of T cells, but their function is impaired. Omenn syndrome has been found to be caused by mutations in the RAG1 or RAG2 genes. Additional causative genes have been identified. Early recognition of this condition is important for genetic counseling and early treatment. If left untreated, Omenn syndrome is fatal. The prognosis may be improved  with early diagnosis and treatment with  compatible bone marrow or cord blood stem cell transplantation.",150,": 

    As an expert in Omenn, it sounds like Omenn syndrome is something that can exist with someone with the condition. In terms of the way that the condition affects the person's personality, it can be described as a personality disorder, which encompasses an individual's tendency to produce a certain type of psychological response. It can have an emotional impact on the person, and could be influenced by negative emotions such as anger or frustration. In general, individuals with Omenn syndrome may develop mood changes, difficulty focusing, and difficulty concentrating in their tasks.

Omenn syndrome caused by mutations in ARTEMIS, ADA, ILRA2, ILRA7, CHD7, and DNA ligase 4 have been described in the medical literature. Some cases of Omenn syndrome have also been found in association with 22q11 microdeletion syndrome.",93,": 

    An Omenn syndrome is caused by a protein called the ""endoblon"" that regulates the production of protein synthesis in the brain.

Endoscopy and biopsy is the only way to confirm the diagnosis of eosinophilic enteropathy. During an endoscopy, a gastroenterologist looks at the gastrointestinal tract through an endoscope and takes multiple small samples (biopsies), which a pathologist reviews. A high number of eosinophils suggests the diagnosis of eosinophilic enteropathy. The pathologist will also look at the location of the eosinophils, changes in the tissue layers, and degranulation (spilling of the contents of the eosinophils). Eosinophils may be normally found in small numbers in all areas of the gastrointestinal tract except the esophagus. However, the number of eosinophils seen in individuals with eosinophilic enteropathy is much higher. Once the diagnosis of eosinophilic enteropathy is confirmed, food allergy testing is typically recommended to guide treatment. Tests for food allergies include skin prick testing, patch testing, and a Radioallergosorbent test (RAST).",142,": 

    The Eosinophilic enteropathy diagnosis is relatively complex, with two distinct classes of cases and multiple stages associated with clinical manifestations. To assess the severity of Eosinophilic enteropathy, practitioners should begin by assessing the patient's initial symptoms, such as a fever, lightheadedness, loss of appetite, and difficulty concentrating. From there, a diagnostic imaging test, such as a radiograph or computed tomography, may be sought to screen for other potential underlying conditions; however, this will not provide definitive documentation of the diagnosis. Additionally, if the patient presents with recurrent infections, antibiotics, and drugs may all be necessary to prevent further complications. Following additional examination and follow-up tests, the physician will assess the patient’s EOSD and make a diagnosis as directed.

The diabetes in MIDD is characterized by high blood sugar levels (hyperglycemia) resulting from a shortage of the hormone insulin, which regulates the amount of sugar in the blood. MIDD is caused by mutations in the MT-TL1, MT-TK, or MT-TE gene. These genes are found in mitochondrial DNA, which is part of cellular structures called mitochondria. Although most DNA is packaged in chromosomes within the cell nucleus, mitochondria also have a small amount of their own DNA (known as mitochondrial DNA or mtDNA). Because the genes involved with MIDD are found in mitochondrial DNA, this condition is inherited in a mitochondrial pattern, which is also known as maternal inheritance. Because egg cells, but not sperm cells, contribute mitochondria to the developing embryo, only females pass mitochondrial conditions to their children. Mitochondrial disorders can appear in every generation of a family and can affect both males and females, but fathers do not pass mitochondrial traits to their children.",179,":

While it is most easily recognized if all the major symptoms are reported, making the diagnosis based solely on symptoms is difficult. People often seek medical help for single symptoms that could be associated with other disorders, particularly epilepsy. In come cases, symptoms are not dramatically apparent for years. Sleep studies are an essential part of the evaluation of people with possible narcolepsy. The combination of an overnight polysomnogram (PSG) followed by a multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) can provide strongly suggestive evidence of narcolepsy, while excluding other sleep disorders. Measurement of hypocretin levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may further help to establish the diagnosis. People with narcolepsy often have extremely low levels of hypocretin in their CSF. In some cases, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing may be helpful.",186,":

Other measures that may help include participating in an exercise program; receiving emotional support and career or vocational counseling; and avoiding high-risk behaviors such as alcohol and drug use, which may make symptoms worse. Common-sense measures should be taken to enhance sleep quality (such as avoiding heavy meals before bed time). Treatment with medications involves the use of central nervous system (CNS) stimulants. These medications help reduce daytime sleepiness and improve this symptom in 65-85% of affected people. Two types of antidepressant drugs (tricyclics, and selective serotonin and noradrenergic reuptake inhibitors) are effective in controlling cataplexy in many people.

9955,9955,15056,inheritance,Is Neonatal progeroid syndrome inherited ?,"Is neonatal progeroid syndrome inherited? Although the underlying genetic cause of neonatal progeroid syndrome is unknown, studies suggest that it is likely inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. This means that to be affected, a person must have a mutation in both copies of the responsible gene in each cell. The parents of an affected person usually each carry one mutated copy of the gene and are referred to as carriers. Carriers typically do not show signs or symptoms of the condition. When two carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) risk to have the condition, a 50% (1 in 2) risk to be a carrier like each of the parents, and a 25% chance to not have the condition and not be a carrier.",134,": 

    The Neonatal progeroid syndrome is recessive and does not affect the birth rate. Neonatal progeroid syndrome is a normal part of baby (birth year) called the 'autogenital stage'. The progesterone body undergoes a full reproductive cycle, giving birth to four fetuses or gametes for each. The genetic code for progesterone is located at the very thylakoid cell of the fetus, called the placenta. These four organs produce the egg, the first egg. The 'autogenital stage' was identified by the scientific community when it's assumed that the birth rate with a placental mammal is much higher than with a normal baby.

Corrective surgery is frequently required for females born with abnormal genitalia. In late childhood and adolescence, maintaining hormonal balance is equally important. Overtreatment may result in obesity and delayed menarche/puberty, whereas under-replacement will result in sexual precocity. Also, it is important that teens and young adults with 21-hydroxylase deficiency be successfully transitioned to adult care facilities. Follow-up of adult patients should involve multidisciplinary clinics.

As a result, surgery to remove the dead, damaged, or infected tissue is the cornerstone of treatment for necrotizing fasciitis. In addition, early surgical treatment may minimize tissue loss, eliminating the need for amputation of the infected extremity. The choice of antibiotics will likely depend on the particular bacteria involved. Supplemental oxygen, fluids, and medicines may be needed to raise the blood pressure. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy and intravenous immunoglobulin may also be considered, but their use in patients with NF is considered controversial by some.",130,":

It most often occurs in persons who are middle-aged and overweight or obese. Many patients with NASH have elevated blood lipids, such as cholesterol and triglycerides, and many have diabetes or prediabetes. However, not every obese person or every patient with diabetes has NASH. Furthermore, some patients with NASH are not obese, do not have diabetes, and have normal blood cholesterol and lipids. NASH can occur without any apparent risk factor and can even occur in children.

NASH is usually first suspected when elevations are noted in liver tests that are included in routine blood test panels. These may include alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST). When further evaluation shows no apparent reason for liver disease (such as medications, viral hepatitis, or excessive use of alcohol) and when x-rays or imaging studies of the liver show fat, NASH is suspected. The only way to definitely diagnosis NASH and separate it from simple fatty liver is through a liver biopsy. For a liver biopsy, a needle is inserted through the skin to remove a small piece of the liver. NASH is diagnosed when examination of the tissue with a microscope shows fat along with inflammation and damage to liver cells. If the tissue shows fat without inflammation and damage, simple fatty liver or NAFLD is diagnosed. An important piece of information learned from the biopsy is whether scar tissue has developed in the liver. Blood tests and scans cannot reliably provide this information at this time.",174,":

This gene provides instructions for making a protein involved in transmitting chemical signals from the cell surface to the nucleus. This signaling pathway, called the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-) pathway, allows the environment outside the cell to affect how the cell produces other proteins. As part of this pathway, the SMAD4 protein interacts with other proteins to control the activity of particular genes. These genes influence many areas of development. Some researchers believe that the SMAD4 gene mutations that cause Myhre syndrome impair the ability of the SMAD4 protein to attach (bind) properly with the other proteins involved in the signaling pathway. Other studies have suggested that these mutations result in an abnormally stable SMAD4 protein that remains active in the cell longer. Changes in SMAD4 binding or availability may result in abnormal signaling in many cell types, which affects development of several body systems and leads to the signs and symptoms of Myhre syndrome.",170,":

10073,10073,15282,causes,What causes Eisenmenger syndrome ?,"What causes Eisenmenger syndrome? Eisenmenger syndrome is caused by a defect in the heart. Most often, the defect is one called a ventricular septal defect (VSD), a hole between the two pumping chambers (the left and right ventricles) of the heart. Other heart defects that can lead to Eisenmenger syndrome include atrial septal defect (ASD) and patent ductus arteriosus (PDA).  The hole allows blood that has already picked up oxygen from the lungs to flow abnormally back into the lungs, instead of going out to the rest of the body. Over time, this increased blood flow can damage the small blood vessels in the lungs. This causes high blood pressure in the lungs. As a result, the blood backs up and does not go to the lungs to pick up oxygen. Instead, the blood goes from the right side to the left side of the heart, and oxygen-poor blood travels to the rest of the body.",156,":

Joubert syndrome and related disorders may be caused by changes (mutations) in any of many genes (some of which are unknown). The proteins made from these genes are either known, or thought, to affect cell structures called cilia. Cilia are projections on the cell surface that play a role in signaling. They are important for many cell types, including neurons, liver cells and kidney cells. Cilia also play a role in the senses such as sight, hearing, and smell. Mutations in the genes responsible for Joubert syndrome and related disorders cause problems with the structure and function of cilia, likely disrupting important signaling pathways during development. However, it is still unclear how specific developmental abnormalities result from these problems.",123,": 

    The Joubert syndrome is a medical condition characterized by a reduced range of hemodynamic control in the right arm. The primary causes of Joubert syndrome are blunt trauma and blunt compression of the elbow joint (joubertic plate) by the elbow muscles. Routeryotic plate is typically caused by compression of the plate with compression of the muscles that pull the elbow joint at high speed.

Most affected individuals experience stroke-like episodes beginning before age 40. People with MELAS can also have a buildup of lactic acid in their bodies that can lead to vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, muscle weakness, and difficulty breathing. The genes associated with MELAS are located in mitochondrial DNA and therefore follow a maternal inheritance pattern (also called mitochondrial inheritance).

HEM is associated with mutations (changes) in the lamin B receptor (LBR) gene located on chromosome 1, specifically at 1q42.1.  Each person has two copies of the LBR gene - one inherited from mom and the other from dad.

The presence of two mutated copies of the LBR gene may affect the structure of the nucleus of the cell as well.",89,": 

    In conclusion, Hydrops is a common cause of myopia and deformity, due to the production of excess skin fibrous fibrous tissue within skeletal muscles. Moth-eaten skeletal dysplasia is also a condition where the surrounding inner surface of the skeletal muscle is not properly constructed, which may allow these tissues to form over time. Myopic calcification is caused by the accumulation of excess skin tissue which leads to a thick, rounded-up, and exaggerated mound under the inner surface of the muscle. The condition can also lead to increased tension and instability in the surrounding tissues and sometimes trigger other neurological and nutritional disorders. It is important to do research in this area and recognize the potential long-term effects of hydrops.

The deletion occurs most often as a random event during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs or sperm) or in early fetal development. Most affected individuals do not have a history of the disorder in their family.  About 10 percent of people with cri du chat syndrome inherit the chromosome abnormality from an unaffected parent. In these cases, the parent carries a chromosomal rearrangement called a balanced translocation, in which no genetic material is gained or lost. Balanced translocations  usually do not cause any health problems; however, they can become unbalanced as they are passed to the next generation. Children who inherit an unbalanced translocation can have a chromosomal rearrangement with extra or missing genetic material. Individuals with cri du chat syndrome who inherit an unbalanced translocation are missing genetic material from the short arm of chromosome 5.

The association of Fowlers syndrome and polycystic ovaries in some patients raises the possibility that the syndrome is linked in some way to impaired muscle membrane stability, owing possibly to a hormonal abnormality. The involvement of such a hormonal abnormality may also explain why it primarily affects premenopausal women.",61,": 

    "" Fowler's syndrome occurs when a person experiences facial expressions that are not consistent with what is expected, such as deep, wide eyes and a thick, thin face. These expressions can seem intimidating or even threatening to their partner’s friends or family. There are several possible explanations as to why some facial features may be present in Fowler’s syndrome, such as being with two identical siblings, an older brother, or a friend.

Diagnosis of Fowlers syndrome involves ruling out neurological or laboratory features that would support a diagnosis of a underlying neurological disease, and identification of a bladder capacity of over 1 liter with no sensation of urgency. Also in Fowlers syndrome, analysis of the striated muscle of the urethral sphincter using concentric needle electrode examination reveals a fairly unique electromyographic (EMG) abnormality. This EMG abnormality is found in association with the urethral sphincter (group of muscles which surround the urinary passage below the bladder), and consists of a type of activity that would be expected to cause inappropriate contraction of the muscle (i.e., impair sphincter relaxation).",110,":

The urinary incontinence caused by Fowlers syndrome may be treated by sacral neuromodulation therapy. The success rate for treatment of Fowlers syndrome with neuromodulation has been estimated to be around 70%, even in women who have been experiencing symptoms for a while. Neuromodulation therapy involves the stimulation of nerves to the bladder leaving the spine. The FDA has approved a device called InterStim for this purpose. Your doctor will need to test to determine if this device would be helpful to you. The doctor applies an external stimulator to determine if neuromodulation works in you. If you have a 50 percent reduction in symptoms, a surgeon will implant the device. Although neuromodulation can be effective, it is not for everyone. The therapy is expensive, involving surgery with possible surgical revisions and replacement. Other treatments that have been tried with little success include hormonal manipulation, pharmacologic therapy, and injections of botulinum toxin.",157,":

There is currently no cure for multiple pterygium syndrome, Escobar type. As a result treatment is aimed at managing the associated symptoms. Orthopedics should be involved for issues arising from scoliosis. Infections should be treated promptly. Contracture releases have been performed with variable outcome. Physical therapy is important to help minimize contractures. When ptosis (droopy eyelids) is present, the patient should be referred to ophthalmology. Patients should also be referred to audiology due to the risk of conductive hearing loss.",88,":

    It might be helpful to start by assessing the patient’s health. The first step is to check for any underlying medical conditions, such as a thyroid condition, cystic fibrosis, heart valve disorder, diabetes mellitus, allergies etc. This helps to check the overall health of the patient. After that, the patient will be checked on their symptoms daily, then take medication or take a course of medication to support better recovery. As a doctor, they will then be able to assess the patient for any possible infection. If it resolves, a new diagnostic test may be necessary.

    Abstract: 
Osteochondritis dissecans is a chronic non-occurring disorder characterized by irregular and severe osteochondritis that can be aggravated by chronic or non-occurrent pain, abrasions, and infections. It is usually triggered by pressure or pressure applied to the joints in the feet, neck, and lower back.  With Osteochondritis dissecans, pain and stress may be a major symptom, making it highly unlikely that the condition is caused by any underlying medical condition. Symptoms may include fatigue, nausea, or vomiting.  These symptoms can have severe, permanent symptoms that must be treated quickly or promptly.

The primary aim of treatment for osteochondritis dissecans is to restore normal function of the affected joint, relieve pain and prevent osteoarthritis. Treatment for the condition varies depending on many factors including the age of the affected person and the severity of the symptoms. In children and young teens, osteochondritis dissecans often heals overtime without surgical treatment. These cases are often managed with rest and in some cases, crutches and/or splinting to relieve pain and swelling. If non-surgical treatments are not successful or the case is particularly severe (i.e. the cartilage and bone are moving around within the joint space), surgery may be recommended. Following surgery, physical therapy is often necessary to improve the strength and range of motion of the affected joint.",129,": 

    It has been established that Osteochondritis dissecans is an autoimmune disorder that arises from the loss of oleumel cells located in the proximal temporal gyrus (PTg1) of the lower limb and the rectum. The present diagnosis is based on the results of an Osteochondritis dissecan screening test.

    
    
     Osteochondritis dissecans is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a deficit in the oestrogen-binding globulin (IGF) and impulsive motor reflexes. The abnormalities, including oleumel cell dysfunction, in PPTG1 can lead to the development of Osteochondritis dissecans.

10253,10253,15618,causes,What causes Schindler disease type 1 ?,"What causes Schindler disease type 1? Schindler disease type 1 is caused by mutations in the NAGA gene. This gene provides instructions for making the enzyme alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase.This enzyme works in the lysosomes  (compartments within cells that digest and recycle materials) to help break down complexes called glycoproteins and glycolipids (sugar molecules attached to certain proteins and fats). More specifically, alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase helps remove a molecule called alpha-N-acetylgalactosamine from sugars in these complexes. Mutations in the NAGA gene interfere with the ability of the alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase enzyme to perform its role in breaking down glycoproteins and glycoliipids. These substances accumulate in the lysosomes and cause cells to malfunction and eventually die. Cell damage in the nervous system and other tissues and organs of the body leads to the signs and symptoms of Schindler disease type 1.",133,": 

    It is certainly possible for Schindler Disease type 1 to occur. Diagnosis and treatment with the right medication are necessary to prevent the disease from spreading.

Ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency is an X-linked disorder. A condition is considered X-linked if the mutated gene that causes the disorder is located on the X chromosome, one of the two sex chromosomes. A characteristic of X-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass X-linked traits to their sons. In males (who have only one X chromosome), one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. In females (who have two X chromosomes), mutations in both copies of the gene will cause the disorder. Some females with only one altered copy of the OTC gene also show signs and symptoms of OTC deficiency.",115,": 

    The only plausible explanation for inheritance is that Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency does not present as an inherited trait - rather, it is a multifactorial one. 
 
In Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency, an allele of the gene responsible for gene regulation is present with each succeeding individual. 
  
Once an individual has a child with gene gene regulation, the individual inherits as a genetically modified individual the first egg produced the second time.  
In fact, the genetic defect in inheritance is common in many species and can even arise from inherited variants of an inherited trait.  
  
It may be that inheritance is the most common and pervasive gene in the population, with multiple variations that modify the gene-carrying function of genes. "

In approximately 90-95% of cases the cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is unknown and is sporadic (occurring in individuals with no history of the condition in the family). The remaining 5-10% of cases are genetic (familial), often occurring in individuals with a family history of the condition. Mutations in any of several genes, including the C9orf72, SOD1, TARDBP, FUS, ANG, ALS2, SETX, and VAPB genes, can cause familial ALS and may contribute to the development of sporadic ALS. About 60% of individuals with familial ALS have an identifiable genetic mutation; the genetic cause in the remaining cases is unknown. The genes associated with ALS appear to play a role in how neurons function or are involved in regulating the production of various proteins. Over the years, various types of environmental exposures have been proposed as possible contributors to the cause of ALS, including mercury, manganese, products used in farming (fertilizers, insecticides, herbicides), and physical and dietary factors. Exposures have been suggested as a possible explanation for the increased incidence of ALS in Gulf War veterans. Further investigation is ongoing.",185,": 

    The cause of Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is not yet fully understood. While it is believed that it is the result of the interplay between genetic and environmental factors, other factors such as genetic exposure to radiation, changes in the metabolic process, and medical conditions have also been linked to the disease over decades. However, there is no cure or treatment for Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Although genetic factors can be responsible for other symptoms, such as fatigue and dizziness, genetic defects in certain genetic codes can help to resolve these conditions.

    Abstract 
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a progressive muscular shear disease characterized by loss of strength, coordination, and joint tension. It is highly progressive and can lead to a disability of the limbs. It is especially prevalent in elderly populations, with the onset of progressive muscle weakness and limited mobility. MS is a chronic disability of the body, caused by an imbalance of mitochondria and fibroblasts in the muscles. However, it is more common in children and teenagers who are at an increased risk for disability.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the first drug treatment for the diseaseriluzole (Rilutek). Riluzole is believed to reduce damage to motor neurons by decreasing the release of glutamate. Clinical trials with ALS patients showed that riluzole prolongs survival by several months, mainly in those with difficulty swallowing. The drug also extends the time before a patient needs ventilation support. Riluzole does not reverse the damage already done to motor neurons, and patients taking the drug must be monitored for liver damage and other possible side effects. Other treatments for ALS are designed to relieve symptoms and improve the quality of life for patients (palliative care). This supportive care is typically provided by multidisciplinary teams of health care professionals such as physicians; pharmacists; physical, occupational, and speech therapists; nutritionists; social workers; and home care and hospice nurses. Working with patients and caregivers, these teams can design an individualized plan of medical and physical therapy and provide special equipment aimed at keeping patients as mobile and comfortable as possible.",178,": 

    The treatment for Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is neurotransdermal patch therapy. With Neurotransdermal Antibodies (NTAs), such as the neuroleukin-converting enzyme NDEA, patients with Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis can live longer life expectancy by using T-cell transplants.

    
    The cure for Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a combination of various therapies, including laser treatment, biopsy tomography, and transcranial fusions. NDEA reduces inflammation and disability-related diseases, improves brain function, and leads to long-term survival. Therefore, patients with Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis can live longer than those without the condition, providing invaluable life-saving treatments for their condition.

    The problem of Chromosome 8q deletion is a common problem in gene expression, and it is often referred to as the transcriptional deficit (TDB) in a population. In a healthy population, this type of deficit often occurs when mutations or mutations in chromatophore DNA occur, leading to abnormal expression of other genetic markers, leading to a condition called paraphyplasmosis. This condition is usually caused by a specific copy of chromatin that changes its gene profile after exposure to repetitive DNA sequences, or some other type of DNA. As a result, the gene's expression can slow down, leading to increased susceptibility to disease. 
   The issue of Chromosome 8q deletion can cause some potential side effects, including increased symptoms of disease, such as headaches, drowsiness,"

The HSPG2 gene codes for the protein perlecan, which is found in muscle and cartilage. Although the role of the perlecan protein is not fully understood, it is thought to play an essential role in many biological activities such as cell signaling and cellular structure. In SJS1, it is suspected that a disturbance in perlecan function leads to a deficiency of acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme involved in breaking down acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that sends messages between nerves, leading to muscle contraction. If acetylcholine is not broken down, it may lead to an prolonged muscle contraction or stiffening of the muscles (myotonia).",121,": 

    From a medical perspective, the main cause of Schwartz Jampel syndrome is the lack of physical activity. While it is possible that the cause can be caused by trauma, it is still a possible cause of a number of other conditions, such as cardiovascular disease, obesity and thyroid disorders. 
   
    Symptoms can vary widely, from extreme pain to muscle relaxation, while physical activity is generally associated with more muscle relaxation. 
   
   

    Since Schwartz Jampel syndrome is a rare disorder, it is crucial that all affected individuals are evaluated and treated before further progress is made.

Individuals with SJS1 inherit one mutated copy of the gene from each parent, who is referred to as a carrier. Carriers of an autosomal recessive condition typically do not have any signs or symptoms (they are unaffected). Rarely, cases of SJS1 with autosomal dominant inheritance have been reported. This means that having a change (mutation) in only one copy of the responsible gene in each cell is enough to cause features of the condition.",123,":

Factor V plays a critical role in the formation of blood clots in response to injury.  Genes are our bodys instructions for making proteins. The factor V gene instructs the body how to make a protein called coagulation factor V. Coagulation factor V is involved in a series of chemical reactions that hold blood clots together. A molecule called activated protein C (APC) prevents blood clots from growing too large by inactivating factor V.,95,": 

    A Leiden thrombophilia arises from a genetic abnormality, known as 'disease T.' Symptoms are usually a mild fever, body aches, and shortness of breath. Symptoms can start anywhere except in one or more of the affected areas (usually between the left ear’s bone and the middle ear’s ear lobe). A person can have a complete breakdown of the bone or brain, as well as loss of function and vision. In rare cases, these symptoms are caused by a wide range of factors, including childhood trauma, exposure to viruses, and physical limitations. These conditions are often classified as Factor V Leiden thrombophilia unless the medical provider(s) confirm the diagnosis and provide a diagnosis as soon as possible.

Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2F (CMT2F) is caused by mutations in the HSPB1 gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein (heat shock protein beta-1) which helps protect cells under adverse conditions. Heat shock proteins appear to be involved in activities such as cell movement, stabilizing the cell's framework, folding and stabilizing new proteins, repairing damaged proteins, and muscle contraction. Heat shock protein beta-1 is particularly abundant in nerve and muscle cells. In nerve cells, it helps to organize a network of threads that maintain the diameter of axons (neurofilaments), which are needed to transmit nerve impulses efficiently. It is unclear exactly how HSPB1 mutations lead to the axon abnormalities characteristic of CMT2F. Researchers suggest that mutations lead to an altered protein which clusters together and interferes with nerve cell function. Another possibility is that the altered protein disrupts the assembly of neurofilaments, which in turn may impair the transmission of nerve impulses.",159,":

This means that both copies of the disease-causing gene in each cell must have a mutation for an individual to be affected. Individuals inherit two copies of each gene - one copy from each parent. Typically, an individual is affected because they inherited a mutated copy of the gene from each parent. Individuals with one mutated copy of the gene (such as an unaffected parent of an affected individual) are referred to as carriers; carriers typically do not have any signs or symptoms of the condition. When two carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) chance to have the condition, a 50% (1 in 2) chance to be a carrier like each of the parents, and a 25% chance to not have the condition and not be a carrier.",152,":

The condition is characterized by severe, early-onset hypertension associated with decreased levels of potassium, renin and aldosterone in blood plasma. Children usually have no symptoms; adults can present with symptoms of low potassium levels (hypokalemia) such as weakness, fatigue, muscle pain (myalgia), constipation or palpitations. It is caused by mutations in either the SCNN1B or SCNN1G genes and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Treatment may include a low sodium diet and potassium-sparing diuretics to reduce blood pressure and normalize potassium levels. Conventional anti-hypertensive therapies are not effective.",101,":

10358,10358,15797,causes,What causes Liddle syndrome ?,"What causes Liddle syndrome? Liddle syndrome is caused by mutations (changes) in either of two genes: SCNN1B and SCNN1G . The SCNN1B gene provides instructions for making one piece (the beta subunit) of protein complexes called epithelial sodium channels (ENaCs). The SCNN1G gene provides instructions for making a different piece (the gamma subunit) of ENaCs. These channels are found at the surface of certain cells called epithelial cells in many tissues of the body, including the kidneys, lungs, and sweat glands. The ENaC channel transports sodium into cells. Mutations in the SCNN1B and SCNN1G genes associated with Liddle syndrome affect an important region of the protein involved in signaling for its breakdown (degradation). As a result of the mutations, the protein is not tagged for degradation, and more ENaC channels remain at the cell's surface. The increase in channels at the cell surface abnormally increases the reabsorption of sodium, which leads to hypertension. Removal of potassium from the blood is linked with reabsorption of sodium into the blood, so excess sodium reabsorption leads to hypokalemia.",175,": 

    The theory that Liddle syndrome is caused by some natural or inherited characteristic  of the spongiform encephalopathy  is supported by genetic and histological evidence.   
        A more comprehensive review of genetic evidence such as mtDNA and DNA methylation is needed to better understand the underlying mechanisms.   
       Understanding the genetics of Liddle syndrome is vital for developing targeted strategies to reduce symptoms in clinical practice and improve diagnostic accuracy.

There are three types of neurofibromatosis that are each associated with unique signs and symptoms: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) causes skin changes (cafe-au-lait spots, freckling in armpit and groin area); bone abnormalities; optic gliomas; and tumors on the nerve tissue or under the skin. Signs and symptoms are usually present at birth. Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) causes acoustic neuromas; hearing loss; ringing in the ears; poor balance; brain and/or spinal tumors; and cataracts at a young age. It often starts in the teen years. Schwannomatosis causes schwannomas, pain, numbness, and weakness. It is the rarest type. All three types of NF are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. There is no cure for neurofibromatosis. Treatment is aimed at controlling symptoms and may include surgery to remove tumors, radiation therapy and/or medicines.",146,":

It has been many years since Neurofibromatosis was first described by Dr. Paul J. Sayers in his book ""The Anatomy of Neurofibromatosis"". It seems that Neurofibromatosis is an autoimmune disorder which occurs in the cells of humans with varying amounts of cell membrane permeability, and is defined by a specific cell membrane-bound protein to regulate immune function.

It was discovered in 1998 that the protein found in Neurofibromatosis is an autoreceptor of neurons and macrophages which is responsible for several different brain processes including memory, vision, and learning. Neurofibromatosis also leads to changes in the activity of other proteins, and it affects a variety of different neurological functions.

The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition. The ALDH7A1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called -aminoadipic semialdehyde (-AASA) dehydrogenase, also known as antiquitin. This enzyme is involved in the breakdown of the protein building block (amino acid) lysine in the brain. When antiquitin is deficient, a molecule that interferes with vitamin B6 function builds up in various tissues. Pyridoxine plays a role in many processes in the body, such as the breakdown of amino acids and the productions of chemicals that transmit signals in the brain (neurotransmitters). It is unclear how a lack of pyridoxine causes the seizures that are characteristic of this condition. Some individuals with pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy do not have identified mutations in the ALDH7A1 gene. In these cases, the cause of the condition is unknown.",186,":

The parents of an affected person usually each carry one mutated copy of the gene and are referred to as carriers. Carriers typically do not have signs or symptoms of the condition. When two carriers of an autosomal recessive condition have children, each child has a 25% (1 in 4) chance to have the condition, a 50% (1 in 2) chance to be a carrier like each of the parents, and a 25% chance to not have the condition and not be a carrier.",141,":

A diagnosis of microhydranencephaly is generally suspected based on the presence of characteristic signs and symptoms. Additional testing can then be ordered to confirm the diagnosis. This generally consists of imaging studies to evaluate the brain for structural abnormalities and severe hydrocephalus (accumulation of fluid in the brain).,52,": 

    The following is a general overview of symptomology on the subject of microhydranencephaly  and its importance in treatment. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, microhydranencephaly is a type of neurological disorder when the skin begins to turn brown or dark green.  Symptoms of microhydranencephaly can include loss of hair follicles, inflammation, and increased pressure and tingling, as well as hearing loss or loss of white hair. Symptoms of microhydranencephaly are often similar to those of hemephhepatic encephalopathy (EKD) and may also include muscle weakness, chest pain, and diarrhea.  Symptoms of microhydranencephaly generally occur within two to four days of presentation.  The severity of symptoms varies depending on"

Signs and symptoms of the condition vary based on the size, location and number of schwannomas but may include pain; numbness; tingling; and/or weakness in the fingers and toes. Inherited forms of the disorder account for only 15 percent of all cases. In some of these families, schwannomatosis is caused by changes (mutations) in the SMARCB1 or LZTR1 genes; in other cases, the exact underlying cause is unknown. When inherited, the condition is passed down in an autosomal dominant manner with highly variable expressivity and reduced penetrance.

10469,10469,16005,causes,What causes Schwannomatosis ?,"What causes schwannomatosis? Some cases of schwannomatosis are caused by changes (mutations) in the SMARCB1 or LZTR1 genes. SMARCB1 and LZTR1 are tumor suppressor genes, which means that they encode a protein that stops cells from growing and dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way. Mutations in these genes result in abnormal proteins that are unable to carry out their normal roles. This contributes to the development of the many different types of tumors found in schwannomatosis. When schwannomatosis is caused by a mutation in SMARCB1 or LZTR1, the affected person is typically born with one mutated copy of the gene in each cell and is, therefore, genetically predisposed to develop the tumors associated with the condition. For a tumor to form, two copies of the gene must be altered. The mutation in the second copy of the gene is considered a somatic mutation because it occurs during a person's lifetime and is not inherited. In affected people without a mutation in SMARCB1 or LZTR1, the underlying cause of the condition is unknown.",174,":

In these cases, the condition is thought to be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner with highly variable expressivity and reduced penetrance. This means that a person only needs a change (mutation) in one copy of the responsible gene in each cell to have a genetic predisposition to the tumors associated with schwannomatosis. In some cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from an affected parent. Other cases may result from new (de novo) mutations in the gene. These cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. People with an inherited form of schwannomatosis have a 50% chance with each pregnancy of passing the condition on to the next generation.",130,":

    In general, Schwannomatosis is caused by the buildup of free radical neutropenia in microvilli. It is generally caused by two or more small cellular infiltrating organelles called microvilli. The microvilli contain large amounts of cell wall adhesion molecules called clonal fibers, which can help absorb and destroy neutrophils. The neutrophils inside the small cells can become inflamed or white patches that can become red, indicating Schwannomatosis. Symptoms include redness, discharge, and swelling of lymph nodes.

Treatment with medications such as gabapentin or pregabalin and the use of short-acting opioids and/or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories for pain can be successful for many patients. If pain cannot be managed with other means or if the schwannomas are causing other symptoms, they can be surgically removed. However this treatment is often used as a last resort because surgery may put patients at risk of further neurologic problems.",99,":

Because glycogen is an important source of energy, this can interfere with the normal functioning of muscle cells. The severity of the condition and the associated signs and symptoms vary, but may include muscle weakness and stiffness; painful muscle cramps; nausea and vomiting; and/or myoglobinuria (the presence of myoglobin in the urine) following moderate to strenuous exercise. Symptoms typically resolve with rest. GSD7 is most commonly diagnosed during childhood; however, some affected people may rarely develop symptoms during infancy or later in adulthood. Those who develop the condition during infancy may experience additional symptoms such as hypotonia (poor muscle tone), cardiomyopathy and breathing difficulties that often lead to a shortened lifespan (less than 1 year). This condition is caused by changes (mutations) in the PFKM gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. There is no specific treatment for GSD7; however, affected people are generally advised to avoid vigorous exercise and high-carbohydrate meals.",181,": 

    MEM\_TYPE\_ 7 is an alkaline or alkali bacteria with the name 'glycogen storage disease'. Glycogen Storage Disease (GGDM) refers to a problem in which bacteria have their cells exposed to substances such as polysaccharides (SSBs) and solvents that are highly reactive or alkaline, causing damage to cells. The organisms commonly found in this condition are certain types of polysaccharides, including yeast and many bacteria. In addition, many types of bacteria carry a high glycosylation content, which can exacerbate the symptoms of GDM.

The signs and symptoms of systemic scleroderma usually begin with episodes of Raynaud's phenomenon, which can occur weeks to years before fibrosis. This may be followed by puffy or swollen hands before the skin becomes thickened and hard. Fibrosis can also affect internal organs and can lead to impairment or failure of the affected organs.

Fibroblasts normally produce collagen and other proteins. Build-up of collagen in the skin and other organs causes the signs and symptoms of the condition. It is suspected that scleroderma may develop from a variety of factors, which may include: Abnormal immune or inflammatory activity Genetic susceptibility: while no specific genes are thought to cause scleroderma, certain genes (or combination of genes) may increase a person's risk to be affected. However, the condition is not passed directly from parents to children. Environmental triggers: suspected triggers may include infections; injury; drugs (e.g. vitamin K, cocaine, penicillamine, appetite suppressants and some chemotherapeutic agents); and chemicals (e.g. silica, organic solvents, pesticides, aliphatic hydrocarbons and epoxy resin). Hormones: because women develop scleroderma more often than men, researchers suspect that hormones may play a role. However, the role of female hormones has not been proven.

Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is caused by mutations in the PABPN1 gene. The PABPN1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is active (expressed) throughout the body. In cells, the PABPN1 protein plays an important role in processing molecules called messenger RNAs (mRNAs), which serve as genetic blueprints for making proteins. The protein acts to protect the mRNA from being broken down and allows it to move within the cell. Mutations in the PABPN1 gene that cause OPMD result in a PABPN1 protein that forms clumps within muscle cells, and hence they cannot be broken down. These clumps are thought to impair the normal function of muscle cells and eventually cause cells to die. The progressive loss of muscle cells most likely causes the muscle weakness seen in people with OPMD. It is not known why abnormal PABPN1 proteins seem to affect muscle cells in only certain parts of the body.",157,": 

    An oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy is a type of muscular dystrophy with a short cut of the pharynx that is responsible for swallowing and swallowing. In Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy, the oesophagus becomes inflamed or blocked.

In adults, symptoms may include shortness of breath; reduced ability to exercise; wheezing; respiratory infections; fatigue; vision problems; and weight loss. Some people have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma. Liver disease (cirrhosis) may occur in affected children or adults. Rarely, AATD can cause a skin condition called panniculitis. AATD is caused by mutations in the SERPINA1 gene and is inherited in a codominant manner. Treatment is based on each person's symptoms and may include bronchodilators; antibiotics for upper respiratory tract infections; intravenous therapy of AAT; and/or lung transplantation in severe cases.",172,":

This gene gives the body instructions to make a protein called alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT), which protects the body from an enzyme called neutrophil elastase. Neutrophil elastase helps the body fight infections, but it can also attack healthy tissues (especially the lungs) if not controlled by AAT. Mutations that cause AAT can cause a deficiency or absence of AAT, or a form of AAT that does not work well. This allows neutrophil elastase to destroy lung tissue, causing lung disease. In addition, abnormal AAT can build up in the liver and cause damage to the liver. The severity of AATD may also be worsened by environmental factors such as exposure to tobacco smoke, dust, and chemicals.",132,":

Tracheobronchomalacia (TBM) is a condition that occurs when the walls of the airway (specifically the trachea and bronchi) are weak. This can cause the airway to become narrow or collapse. There are two forms of TBM. Primary TBM (also called congenital TBM) typically develops during infancy or early childhood, while secondary TBM (also called acquired TBM) is usually seen in adults. Some affected people may initially have no signs or symptoms. However, the condition is typically progressive (becomes worse overtime) and many people will eventually develop characteristic features such as shortness of breath, cough, sputum retention (inability to clear mucus from the respiratory tract), and wheezing or stridor with breathing. Symptoms may become worse during periods of stress (i.e. illness), when reclining, or when forcing a cough. Infants and young children with TBM tend to have more frequent respiratory infections and delayed recovery from these illnesses.",154,":

10601,10601,16247,causes,What causes Tracheobronchomalacia ?,"What causes tracheobronchomalacia? The underlying cause of tracheobronchomalacia (TBM) varies by subtype. Most cases of primary TBM (also called congenital TBM) are caused by genetic conditions that weaken the walls of the airway (specifically the trachea and bronchi). For example, TBM has been reported in people with mucopolysaccharidoses (such as Hunter syndrome and Hurler syndrome), Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, and a variety of chromosome abnormalities. Primary TBM can also be idiopathic (unknown cause) or associated with prematurity and certain birth defects (i.e. tracheoesophageal fistula). The secondary form (also called acquired TBM) is caused by the degeneration (break down) of cartilage that typically supports the airways. It is most commonly associated with: Certain medical procedures such as endotracheal intubation or tracheostomy Conditions that lead to chronic (persisting or progressing for a long period of time) inflammation such as relapsing polychondritis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) Cancers, tumors, or cysts that cause prolonged compression of the airway",154,": 

    Curious because I don't believe in miracles, the other causes of Tracheobronchomalacia are not linked with the natural effects of the disease and may be preventable by lifestyle interventions.

This condition causes teeth to be unusually small, discolored, pitted or grooved, and prone to rapid wear and breakage. These dental problems, which vary among affected individuals, can affect both primary (baby) teeth and permanent teeth. There are 4 main types of AI that are classified based on the type of enamel defect.

In general, the both primary and permanent teeth are affected. The enamel tends to be soft and weak, and the teeth appear yellow and damage easily. The defects associated with amelogeneis imperfecta are highly variable and include abnormalities classified as hypoplastic (defects in the amount of enamel), hypomaturation (defect in the final growth and development of the tooth enamel), and hypocalcification (defect in the initial stage of enamel formation followed by defective tooth growth). The enamel in the hypomaturation and hypocalcification types is not mineralized and is thus described as hypomineralized. Traditionally, the diagnosis and classification of amelogenesis imperfecta is based on the clinical presentation and the mode of inheritance. There are four principal types based on the defects in the tooth enamel. These types are subdivided into 14 different subtypes based on the clinical presentation and the mode of inheritance.

These genes provide instructions for making proteins that are essential for normal tooth development. These proteins are involved in the formation of enamel, which is the hard, calcium-rich material that forms the protective outer layer of each tooth. Mutations in any of these genes alter the structure of these proteins or prevent the genes from making any protein at all. As a result, tooth enamel is abnormally thin or soft and may have a yellow or brown color. Teeth with defective enamel are weak and easily damaged. In some cases, the genetic cause of amelogenesis imperfecta can not been identified. Researchers are working to find mutations in other genes that are responsible for this disorder.

10609,10609,16259,inheritance,Is Amelogenesis imperfecta inherited ?,"How is amelogenesis imperfecta inherited? Amelogenesis imperfecta can have different patterns of inheritance, depending on the gene that is altered. Most cases are caused by mutations in the ENAM gene and are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. This type of inheritance means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Amelogenesis imperfecta may also be inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern; this form of the disorder can result from mutations in the ENAM or MMP20 gene. Autosomal recessive inheritance means two copies of the gene in each cell are altered. About 5 percent of amelogenesis imperfecta cases are caused by mutations in the AMELX gene and are inherited in an X-linked pattern. A condition is considered X-linked if the mutated gene that causes the disorder is located on the X chromosome, one of the two sex chromosomes. In most cases, males with X-linked amelogenesis imperfecta experience more severe dental abnormalities than females with this form of this condition. Other cases of amelogenesis imperfecta result from new mutations in these genes and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.",191,":

There are two main types of meningoencephalocele, which are named according to the location of the sac. The frontoethmoidal type is located at the frontal and ethmoid bones while the occipital type is located at the occipital bone.  Hydrocephalus, abnormalities of the eyeball and tear duct, and other findings have been associated with the condition. Some affected individuals have intellectual or physical disabilities while others have normal development and abilities.  The condition is typically congenital (present at birth) but has been reported to develop by chance in older individuals in rare cases. The underlying cause of the condition is uncertain, but environmental factors are thought to play a role. Treatment depends on the size, location and severity of the defect but mainly includes magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to determine the severity of the defect, followed by surgery to repair it.",173,":

People affected by this condition often have a blood abnormality called monoclonal gammopathy, a condition in which the body over-produces certain immunoglobulins (typically immunoglobulin M). Immunoglobulins are proteins that are made by certain white blood cells. They play a role in the immune response by helping destroy bacteria, viruses, and other substances that appear foreign and harmful. Some researchers believe that the abnormal accumulation of immunoglobulins in the skin and other parts of the body may play a role in the development of the signs and symptoms of Schnitzler syndrome. Other scientists speculate that alterations in cytokines may play a role in the development of Schnitzler syndrome. Cytokines are specialized proteins that play an important role in the immune response.

10669,10669,16381,causes,What causes Juvenile Huntington disease ?,"What causes Juvenile Huntington disease (HD)? Mutations in the HTT gene cause Huntington disease. The HTT gene provides instructions for making a protein called huntingtin. Although the function of this protein is unknown, it appears to play an important role in nerve cells (neurons) in the brain. When the huntingtin protein is abnormally made, it is thought to lead to the death of neurons in certain areas of the brain, which causes the signs and symptoms of Juvenile HD. The HTT mutation that causes Huntington disease involves a DNA segment known as a CAG trinucleotide repeat. This segment is made up of a series of three DNA building blocks (cytosine, adenine, and guanine) that appear multiple times in a row. Normally, the CAG segment is repeated 10 to 35 times within the gene. In people with juvenile HD, the CAG segment is repeated more than 60 times.",147,":

10670,10670,16382,inheritance,Is Juvenile Huntington disease inherited ?,"How is Juvenile Huntington disease (HD) inherited? Juvenile HD is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, which means that one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. An affected person usually inherits the altered gene from one affected parent. As the altered HTT gene is passed from one generation to the next, the size of the CAG trinucleotide repeat often increases in size. A larger number of repeats is usually associated with an earlier onset of signs and symptoms (anticipation). A larger number of repeats is usually associated with an earlier onset of signs and symptoms. Most often, children with juvenile HD inherit the expanded CAG trinucleotide repeat from their fathers, although on occasion they inherit it from their mothers.",127,": 

    It is difficult to understand the issue of juvenile Huntington disease. Genetic testing can provide a more accurate and consistent diagnosis for the disease, as certain genes play an important role in the development, functioning, and course of Huntington disease. However, in my experience, genetics alone cannot provide a definitive diagnosis of Huntington disease, and if the genetic testing is inadequate, it could contribute to any of several conditions, including depression, ADHD, and autism.

It is important to remember however, that while medicines may help keep these clinical symptoms under control, there is no treatment to stop or reverse the course of the disease. Anticonvulsant drugs are usually prescribed to help prevent and control the seizures that occur in children with Juvenile HD. Tetrabenazine is often used to treat chorea. Antipsychotic drugs, such as haloperidol, or other drugs, such as clonazepam, may also help to alleviate chorea and may also be used to help control hallucinations, delusions, and violent outbursts. For depression, physicians may prescribe fluoxetine, sertraline, nortriptyline, or other drugs.

However, scientists have proposed several theories. For example, some cases of LPHS may be due to abnormal glomerular basement membranes, which are the tissues in the kidney that filter blood. If these tissues are abnormal, red blood cells may be allowed to enter the urinary space, leading to both loin pain and hematuria (blood in the urine). Other factors that may lead to the signs and symptoms of LPHS include: Blood disorders, called coagulopathies, which impair the bloods ability to clot Spasms in the kidney's blood vessels which may restrict blood flow to certain tissues and lead to tissue death Up to 50% of people affected by LPHS also experience kidney stones. Some scientists, therefore, suspect that the formation of crystals and/or stones in the kidney may also contribute to the condition as they may block or injure the renal tubules (the long narrow tubes in the kidney that concentrate and transport urine).",172,":

10680,10680,16399,treatment,What are the treatments for Loin pain hematuria syndrome ?,"How might loin pain hematuria syndrome be treated? Treatment of loin pain hematuria syndrome (LPHS) typically consists of pain management. Narcotics or oral opioids may be prescribed to help control pain. Patients with severe pain may need high-dose opioids daily and may occasionally require hospitalization for intravenous pain relievers and control of nausea. Limited evidence suggests that drugs that inhibit angiotensin may reduce the frequency and severity of episodes of loin pain and severe hematuria. People with debilitating pain who do not respond to other therapies may be offered surgery (i.e. a nerve block, nephrectomy, kidney auto-transplantation); however, surgical treatment of LPHS is controversial as studies suggest that it has limited value for treating recurrent pain.",116,": 

    The two major medications used for Loin pain hematuria syndrome are corticosteroids and opioids. Corticosteroids (the two main medications sold in the US every year) reduce fever by inhibiting the secretion of catecholamines. Opinoids (the two main drugs sold in the UK at an average price of £1.80 per 100ml) effectively induce a range of relaxation and muscle relaxation actions associated with Loin pain. Therefore, it is generally thought that the combination of these two medications can lead to relief from Loin pain. Additionally, opiods have anti-inflammatory properties that can significantly reduce inflammation associated with Loin pain. Lastly, opioids have long history of abuse and contribute to Loin pain.
